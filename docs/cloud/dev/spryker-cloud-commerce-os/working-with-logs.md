This document describes how to work with logs(events). Logs provide information about the state of application and related services. In Spryker Cloud Commerce OS, logging is maintained by [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html).


## Log groups

To make log browsing easier, logs from the same source form a log stream. Log streams with the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings form a log group. You can check logs from the following log groups.

| HEADER | HEADER |
| --- | --- |
| AWS code build pipelines | DESTRUCTIVE pipeline jobs: /aws/codebuild/danger/{environment_name} <br> NORMAL pipeline jobs: /aws/codebuild/{environment_name} |
| AWS Elasticsearch | /aws/elasticsearch/{environment_name} |
| AWS RDS instances | /aws/rds/instance/{environment_name}/error |
| AWS Certificates expiration | /aws/lambda/{environment_name}-certificate-expiration |
| AWS Codebuild | /codebuild |
| EC2 Jenkins | /ec2/{environment_name}/jenkins/docker |
| ECS blackfire | /ecs/fargate/{environment_name}/blackfire/docker |
| Frontend service | /ecs/{environment_name}/frontend/docker |
| GLUE service | /ecs/{environment_name}/glue/docker |
| ECS Jenkins | /ecs/{environment_name}/jenkins/docker |
| RabbitMQ ECS | /ecs/{environment_name}/rabbitmq/docker |
| ECS YVES | /ecs/{environment_name}/yves/docker |
| ECS ZED | /ecs/{environment_name}/zed/docker |
