This document describes how to generate access keys. Access keys are used to access AWS Command Line Interface and connect integrated development environments, like PhpStorm.

You can only generate an access key for your own account. If you want to create another account and generate an access key for that account, [contact support](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/).

{% endinfo_block %}

To generate an access key:

1. In the AWS Management Console navigation bar, select your username > **My Security Credentials**.

2. On the *My security credentials* page, select **Create access key**.
![Create access key button](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Security/Generating+access+keys/create-access-key-button.png)
    This opens the Create access key window with the success message displayed. Your access key has been generated.
3. To download the access key, select **Download .csv** file.

You've generated and downloaded your access key.
