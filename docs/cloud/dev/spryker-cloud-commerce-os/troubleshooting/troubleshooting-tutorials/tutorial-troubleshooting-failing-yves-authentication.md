Yves authentication fails for all customers.

Since it's a customer-side issue, you need to go through customer-related stages of information flow (red arrrows on the diagram). The default information flow is frontend > Yves > Zed (boffice).

As authentication is not related to the frontend itself, you can skip it when troubleshooting through the flow.


## Check logs

Check Yves, and Zed (backoffice) logs as follows. Filter log groups by `yves` and `zed` ( `boffice` ).
