When someone requests your review of a pull request, you get an email about the request. <!--Also, a message with the review request is displayed on the pull request page:IMAGE-->

To review a pull request, do the following:

1. At the pull request page, click the **Files changed** tab.
Here you can see how many files have been changed and the changes themselves. Old text is displayed in red, the new one - in green:
![Files changed](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contributing-to-documentation/files-changed.png)

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

You can view each file in a more readable form: with images, normally-looking tables, etc. For this, click on three dots at the file path and select **View file**:

![View file](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contributing-to-documentation/view-file.png)

Keep in mind that you won't see the old text in the *View file* mode. Only new text is shown in this mode.

{% endinfo_block %}

2. Hover over the line of text where you'd like to add a comment and click the blue comment icon. A comment field appears:
![Comment field](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contributing-to-documentation/comment-box.png)

3. In the comment field, enter your comment and click **Start a review**:
![Start a review](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contributing-to-documentation/start-a-review.png)

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

To suggest a specific change to the line that would replace the author's text with yours, click **Insert a suggestion**, then edit the text within the suggestion block:

![Insert a suggestion](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contributing-to-documentation/insert+a+suggestion.png)

Keep in mind that suggesting a change is preferable in case of typos, restructuring a text, and other edits that do not require discussions or specific input from the author. Implementing the suggested changes is easier for the author than resolving the comments.

{% endinfo_block %}

Before you submit your review, your line comments are pending and only visible to you. You can edit pending comments anytime before you submit your review.

4. Optional: After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review:
![Viewed files](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/contributing-to-documentation/viewed.png)

5. Once you are done reviewing all the files, click **Review changes** in the top right corner and select either *Comment*, *Approve* or *Request changes*.
   
6. Click **Submit review**:
