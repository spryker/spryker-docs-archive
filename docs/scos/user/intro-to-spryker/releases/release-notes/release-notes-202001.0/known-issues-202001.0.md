During the [202001.0 product release](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202001.0/release-notes-202001.0.html), we have found some issues that will be fixed in the nearest future.
This page contains the list of features and their issues. 

## Reorder the Previous Order 

* If an order contains a Bundle product reorder functionality does not work.
* If an order contains a product with measurement units, reorder functionality does not work.

## Split Delivery
Product Bundles are shown as a list of individual items instead of a Bundled item on the Edit shipment page in the Back Office on the Order Details page.  

## File Manager
In the B2C File Uploader in the Back Office, an error is thrown upon a file upload, and a file cannot be uploaded.

## Concrete Products
Price per Concrete Products canâ€™t be empty during the saving of the Concrete Products; at least one price should be listed. Inheritance for all other prices from Abstract to Concrete Products are working.
