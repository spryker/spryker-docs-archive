Spryker Documentation is a central hub for knowledge and information about the [Spryker Commerce OS](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/about-spryker.html#what-is-the-spryker-commerce-os). It details the aspects involved with setting up and using Spryker for your project.

We try to organize our documentation in such a way that it would be easy to find and utilize for various target users. To achieve this, we do the following:

* [Split documentation](#documentation-breakdown) into documentation for specific target groups and tasks they want to accomplish.
* Separate feature documentation into articles for various [personas](#personas): Developer, Back-Office User, and Shop User.
* Version documentation according to the [product releases](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes.html). To select a version for a specific product release, choose the version in the green dropdown on the right of each article.
*	Use [tags](#tags) to distinct documentation by product versions and help you understand whether the documentation refers to B2B or B2C features.
<!--* Use [In-App assistant](#inapp) to allow finding documentation faster.-->

## Documentation Breakdown
The Spryker documentation is broken into the following sections:
**[About](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/about-spryker.html)**: Is for people who are thinking about adopting the Spryker Commerce OS.

## Personas
In our documentation, we refer to the following personas:

* Developer
* Back Office User
* Shop User

We also use these personas to categorize articles related to individual features. See [Business on Behalf feature summary page](/docs/scos/user/features/{{site.version}}/company-account-feature-overview/business-on-behalf-overview.html) for example.
The table below shows what specific roles each persona includes and what each role is up to:
