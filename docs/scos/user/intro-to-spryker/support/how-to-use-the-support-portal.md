## Overview

This article describes how to use the support portal to create and manage your cases

## Prerequisites

You already have a customer login provisioned for you. If you do not have an account yet, please request one using this form.
You can log in to the[ support portal](https://support.spryker.com) by using the login button on the top right.

## Creating new cases

You can create cases by using the drop down menu “Create a case” and selecting the respective case type, or by clicking on the case type on the landing page. When creating cases, please make use of the recommendations explained [here](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/support/how-to-share-secrets-with-the-spryker-support-team.html).

### Questions

Requests can be questions or Change Requests that we do not yet offer as categories in “Hosting Change Requests”.

### Problems

Problems can be reports suspecting a bug or issues with our hosting. Please make sure that you follow this guide to include everything we need to get working on your case right away.

### Emergencies

Emergencies are reserved for problems that have significant business impact now or very soon. Emergency cases regularly start an [escalation](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/support/escalations.html). Please do not use this case type to simply try to speed up requests or problem reports. Emergencies need to be associated with significant risk or business impact, like revenue, security, or go-lives.

### Platform Change Requests

These requests will be automatically forwarded to our DevOps team. Therefore, please make sure that you provide all the information that we ask for in the forms so that the team can get things done without having to ask for further information. If you do not find a Change Request type for your request, please use a Request case type to contact us.

**Please allow 3-5 days of processing time for Change Requests**
In cases you need changes done at a certain date, please include that information in the change request description.

## Managing Cases

Clicking on “Our Cases” brings you to a list view of all cases that you have opened with us. If you want to take a look at the details of a particular case, just click on the case number and it will bring you to the detail page of that particular case. Here you can perform actions like asking for revision of assigned priority, taking a look at the communication history, and see the current status of the case and any Jira Ticket that might be associated with the case.
