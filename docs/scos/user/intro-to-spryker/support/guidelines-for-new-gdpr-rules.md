{% info_block errorBox %}

This article conforms the [DSGVO](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datenschutz-Grundverordnung) and [RGPD](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A8glement_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral_sur_la_protection_des_donn%C3%A9es) rules.

{% endinfo_block %}

As of May the 25th, 2018, the new General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) take effect. This document describes how the Spryker Commerce OS is compliant with the GDPR.

GDPR is a set of rules related to the protection and control of personal data.
For more information about GDPR, see:
* [GDPR official site](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679)
* [GDPR summary](https://gdpr-info.eu/)

In terms of functionality, compliance is established through a customer’s ability to delete their account information and subscribe or unsubscribe to newsletters. Shop owners can delete customer accounts through the Back Office. In both cases, these actions do not affect billing and order related information. Account deletion anonymizes customer information and address data but keeps the relevant transaction details.

However, Spryker has no complete access to customer implementations and has no control systems that are implemented and deployed. Therefore, we can only provide partial aid with GDPR compliance by providing features (like account deletion or consent withdrawal) to support customers becoming GDPR compliant.

To support our customers, we compiled a few notes and guidelines that can help. This information does not replace  official legal consulting, which we advise to take for each company. Moreover, all the customers that use third-party and own integrations with their infrastructure (database, log files, CRM, mail providers), need to oversee GDPR compliance of those connections too.

## General e-commerce guidelines

|  WHAT TO DO | HOW | WHEN |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  1. Collect only what you need. | <ul><li>Only ask customers for the data necessary for processing a request. Avoid collecting as much as you can without a reason.</li><li> Review your forms, such as registration forms, subscription forms, contact forms, log files, and third-party integrations. Assess if you can justify each piece of information you collect.</li></ul> | During project implementation and before going live. For live projects, assess, evaluate and implement changes before May the 25th, 2018. |
|  2. Explain why the information collected is necessary.     | Review your data privacy statement, terms & conditions, newsletter subscription conditions, and promo campaign conditions. Tips: Explain why certain data is needed to be collected in simple language. Avoid very long texts. | During the Project implementation process and before going live with your project.
