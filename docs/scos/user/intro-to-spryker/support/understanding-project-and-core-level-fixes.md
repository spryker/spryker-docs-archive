This short article will explain the differences between project and core level fixes to problems and bugs.

## Project Level Fixes

Sometimes it is important to react fast and to provide an undemocratic solution to an urgent problem. This is where project level fixes come into place. We use this type of fixes to solve problems on a project level. If a reported problem is relatively simple, but has high business impact, we sometimes provide a patch. This patch might not run through the normal QA and review processes and has the singular purpose of solving a problem with high business impact as fast as possible and buy the time necessary to provide a proper solution.
We also usually try to avoid project level fixes where possible, because they do not make Spryker better for everyone and treat symptoms rather than solving the core issue.

## Core Level Fixes

While often taking a considerable amount of time, depending on the urgency of a particular issue, core level fixes undergo rigorous QA processes. These fixes are also reviewed by seasoned Spryker architects before release.

## Summary

Wherever the circumstances allow, we will try to provide a core level fix. If the problem is sufficiently urgent, there might be an option to develop a project level fix for certain problems, however, this should always be viewed as a temporary solution.
