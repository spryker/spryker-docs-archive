Very easy: Use our [Support Portal ](https://support.spryker.com)

Opening a case via this form is the preferred way, as the form will help you include information we need to get working on a case immediately and speed up our case resolution time.

If your case is not an emergency, please take the time to learn [How Spryker Support Works](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/support/how-spryker-support-works.html) and [How To Get The Most Out Of Support](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/support/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-spryker-support.html). Both articles give valuable insights into the inner workings of Spryker Support and will help you help us to provide an excellent support experience for you.
