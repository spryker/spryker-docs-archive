In Zed there’s a section (*Search and Filters -> Search Preferences*) for managing searchable product attributes.

To be able to search after a product in the shop that has a specific attribute (e.g. color, size, etc.), you can click **Add attribute to search** to create new, or **Edit** if it already exists in your list then set “full text” or “full text boosted” settings to “Yes”.

After adding/updating all necessary attributes, you’ll need to apply the changes by clicking **Synchronize search preferences**. This will trigger an action that searches for all products that have those attributes and were modified since the last synchronization and *touches* them. This means that next time, the search collector execution will update the necessary products, so they can be found by performing a full text search.

{% info_block infoBox "Synchronization " %}
Depending on the size of your database, the synchronization can be slow sometimes. Make sure that you don't trigger it often if it's not necessary.
{% endinfo_block %}

To have your search collector collect all the dynamic product attributes, make sure you also followed the steps described in the Dynamic product attribute mapping section.

## Current Constraints

{% info_block infoBox %}
Currently, the feature has the following functional constraints which are going to be resolved in the future.
{% endinfo_block %}

* search preference attributes are shared across all the stores in a project
* you cannot define a search preference for a single store
