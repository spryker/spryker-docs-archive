An **agent** is a person who helps customers to perform various activities in an online store. For example, a customer might call an agent and ask him/her to help choose a right product and assist in the buying process or even perform some actions in the web-shop for them. Say the customer is willing to add items to shopping list, or create a company, but can not do it for some reason. This is when the agent comes in and provides practical support by carrying out actions on customer's behalf in the web-shop.

The agent user can be created in the Back Office under _Users Control â†’ User_.

{% info_block infoBox %}
In fact, any Back Office user can be agent, all you need to do for that is select the _This user is an agent check-box_ on the _User create/edit page_, and the user gets the Agent mark. See Adding New Users to learn more how to create a new agent user in the Admin UI.
{% endinfo_block %}

## How does it work?
To act on customer's behalf, the agent signs in to web-shop via `http://mysprykershop.com/agent/login` link with the agent account details and selects the right customer by typing their name or email in the customer search field.

Once necessary customer is found in the customer search field, the agent clicks **Confirm**.

{% info_block infoBox %}
This virtually logs the agent in to the web-shop under the selected customer, so he/she sees the webshop just the way the customer does: with all their wishlists, shopping lists etc., and can do anything the customer asked for.<br>If customer's cart is stored in the database (not in session
{% endinfo_block %}, the agent sees the cart and all its items as well.)

Having performed the necessary actions requested by the customer, the agent ends the customer assistance session by clicking **End Customer Assistance**.
