The feature guides provide detailed descriptions of features, highlights their functional abilities, business values, and use-case examples. This information might be useful for:
* Business owners
* Product owners
* Anyone looking to learn more about the Spryker features or add new functionality to a Spryker-based project

The *Features* section unfolds into a list of capabilities. Each capability contains a capability description and conceptual documentation of all features the capability includes.

In the feature documentation, you will find the following information:
* A short summary of a feature with lists of guidelines designed for different [personas](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/about-spryker-documentation.html#personas).
* A detailed overview of a feature, workflows, database structure, and more.

This documentation is meant for reference purposes only and does not contain step-by-step guides. If you need specific guides on how to use or install a feature, go to its summary page (for example, the [Content Items](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/content-items-feature-overview.html) feature summary), and depending on your role, find the guide in the **If you are** table.

Or, you can go directly to the following guides to search for the necessary information:

* [Back Office user guide](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/about-back-office-user-guides.html): for step-by-step guides on how to work with the features in the Back Office.
* [Feature integration guides](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/feature-integration-guides.html): for developer guides on how to integrate a feature into a Spryker project.
