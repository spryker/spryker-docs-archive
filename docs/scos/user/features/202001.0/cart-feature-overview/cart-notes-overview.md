The **Cart Notes** enable Shop administrators to include a "Notes" field on the cart page. Customers can add notes to a particular item or the whole cart, e.g some special instructions about how to prepare and deliver an order.

The cart note is added to quote or to a particular item in the quote and pushed to order details.

The shop administrator can see the special request in the **Back Office: Sales > Orders** section:

## Current Constraints
In a situation, when the same product variants are added to the cart with different notes, the variants get merged with the same note.
