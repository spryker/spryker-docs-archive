There are times when shop owners might not want their customers to buy less or more of specific products. For example, when selling to bulk buyers at wholesale prices, you might want not to allow buying less than a certain quantity of products, or when running promotional campaigns and creating special offers, it might be reasonable to limit the allowable quantity of specific products in cart to a certain value. Also, for some products it might be more convenient to sell such quantities, that would be multiples of a specific number. For example, you don't sell less than 3 meters of cable and don't want your customers to buy cables which length is not a multiple of 3.

The Product Quantity Restrictions feature enables you to easily handle all such situations, as you can restrict the amount of products your customers are allowed to put to cart by setting specific minimum, maximum and interval values for the products.
