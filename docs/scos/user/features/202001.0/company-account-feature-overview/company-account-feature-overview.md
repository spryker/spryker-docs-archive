**Business Value**
* Ensure a secure and reliable Company Role and Business Unit Management
***
Provide your B2B Customers with a way to accurately map their business hierarchies, permissions and role management. With the creation of distinctive Business Units, the internal hierarchy can easily be mapped and each Unit can operate independently. This is especially useful if your customer’s company is operating multiple locations or warehouses. A convenient Roles & Permissions System enables your customer’s buyers to clearly define purchasing and approval processes. By default a standard set of Roles is defined and Permissions attributed. Each user inside a Company Account can have multiple Roles and Permissions and belong to more than one Busines Unit. By providing this structure customers (buyers) on a Spryker system may accurately model their purchasing processes according to their real company structure.
