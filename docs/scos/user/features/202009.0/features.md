The feature guides describe features in details, highlight their functional abilities, business values, and use-case examples. This information might be useful for:
* Business owners
* Product owners
* Anyone looking to learn more about the Spryker features or add new functionality to a Spryker-based project

The *Features* section is divided into capabilities. Each capability contains a capability description and conceptual documentation of all the features a capability includes.

In the feature documentation, you will find the following information:

* A short feature summary with guidelines designed for different [personas](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/about-spryker-documentation.html#personas).
* A detailed feature overview, workflows, database structure, and more.

The documentation in the *Features* section provides reference information that should not be used as guidelines. If you want to learn how to use or install a feature, you can find all the guides related to a feature on its summary page, like [Content items](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/content-items-feature-overview.html).

Or, you can go directly to the following guides:

* [Back Office user guide](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/about-back-office-user-guides.html): for step-by-step guides on how to work with the features in the Back Office.
* [Feature integration guides](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/feature-integration-guides.html): for developer guides on how to integrate a feature into a Spryker project.
