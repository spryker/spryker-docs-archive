Every e-commerce shop reaches that moment when they need to stand out among competitors in order to attract more customers. The first thing that a buyer pays attention to when visiting an online store is the interface - layout, colors, design. Creating a perfect theme for multiple stores on various occasions, for example, Hallowing sale, Black Friday sale or Christmas, has become possible with the Multi-Theme feature provided by the Spryker Commerce OS.
