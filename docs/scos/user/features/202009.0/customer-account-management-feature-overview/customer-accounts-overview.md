A *customer account* contains the following customer information on the Storefront:

* Contact details
* Addresses
* Order history
* Preferences, such as language and shipping options

There are slight differences in customer accounts' information for the B2B and B2C shops. The following table describes such differences and similarities:

| Customer Account sections | B2B Shop | B2C Shop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | ✓ | ✓|
| Profile | ✓ | ✓ |
| Addresses | ✓ | ✓ |
| Order History | ✓ | ✓ |
| Newsletter | ✓ | ✓ |
| Shopping Lists | ✓ |  |
| Shopping Carts | ✓ |  |
| Wishlist |  | ✓ |

See [Customer Registration overview](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/customer-account-management-feature-overview/customer-registration-overview.html) for details on how customer accounts can be created.


Customers manage their accounts directly on the Storefront. If a customer updates an account, the data is synchronized, and the Back Office user sees the updated information in the Back Office > **Customers** > **Customers** section. The exceptions are newsletter subscriptions and password changes: this information is not stored in the Back Office.


To comply with international regulations, a Back Office user can delete a customer account on a customer request.

{% info_block warningBox %}

Deleting a customer account does not affect billing and order-related information. Deleting an account anonymizes customer information and address data. By default, customer email addresses are anonymized, making it possible for customers to return and re-register with a completely new account.

{% endinfo_block %}

A Back Office user can do the following:

* Add notes attached for customers.
* Set a preferred locale per customer.
* Deleting a customer data via an anonymization mechanism.
* Configure a non-linear customer reference for external communication.
* Set address books with default addresses for billing and shipping.
* Send a password token via email.
* Check last orders of a customer in the shop.

See [Managing customers](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/customer/customer-customer-access-customer-groups/managing-customers.html) for details.
