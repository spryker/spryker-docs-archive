The *Customer Account Management* feature enables a wide range of management options for customer accounts, as well as additional functionalities.

Customers create accounts to save their personal details. Back Office users manage the accounts: view and edit customer details, check orders, and add notes.  Customer accounts can have the following details:

* Contact details
* Addresses
* Order history
* Language and shipping preferences

Password management enables the basic password security for customer accounts. It allows customers to:

* Specify the account password when registering.
* Change the password in their customer account.
* Request a password reset email.

Also, it allows you to manage customer access, request a password change or change it on your side.
