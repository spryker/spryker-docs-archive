Sometimes customers need more than one shopping cart, for example, one for daily purchases, the other one for monthly expenses. The *Multiple Carts* feature allows you to create and manage multiple shopping carts in one customer account.

## Creating and managing multiple shopping carts
There are two ways to create a shopping cart:

* Through a shopping cart widget in the header of shop.
* From the *Shopping Cart* page in the *My Account* menu.

New items are added to the shopping cart by clicking **Add to Cart** on the product details page.

Customers can create not just one but multiple shopping carts to be used for different needs.

{% info_block infoBox %}
These could be, for instance, a shopping cart for daily purchases or a shopping cart for goods that you purchase once in a month.
{% endinfo_block %}

After a shopping cart has been created, it appears in the shopping carts table on the *Shopping Cart* page in *My Account*.

The table with shopping carts shows details for each of the carts, including:

* Name of the shopping cart
* Access level (Owner, Read-only or Full access)
* Number of products added to cart
* Price mode (Net or Gross)
* Cart Total
* Possible actions to manage shopping carts: edit name, duplicate, [share](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/shared-carts-feature-overview.html), dismiss, delete, switch cart to shopping list (see the *Actions* table for details)

The table bellow provides detailed information on the possible actions to manage shopping carts.

| ACTION | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| Edit Name | Allows a customer to edit the name of the shopping cart. |
| Duplicate | Creates a copy of the chosen shopping cart including the items added to the cart.<br>The duplicate copy of the cart is named according to the template: `<Name of the original cart> Copied At <Mo. dd, yyyy hh:mm>` <br>A cart can be converted into shopping list on the *Shopping cart* page by clicking on **To shopping list**.|
| Dismiss | Allows a customer to dismiss a shared shopping cart. |
| Delete | Deletes the shopping cart. <br>Deleting a shopping cart also deletes the items added to it. |
