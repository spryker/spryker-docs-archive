 The Spryker Commerce OS lets you accurately model your business structure in the Administration Interface in order to reflect Purchasing Process, Permissions and Roles. With the Company Account, hierarchical business units, shipping and billing addresses as well as permission management are easily set. This is the basis for many following B2B environment features, that ensure smooth and safe processes.

Companies can contain many business units, which are made up of one or more company users. By providing this structure customers (buyers) on a Spryker system may accurately model their purchasing processes according to their real company structure.
