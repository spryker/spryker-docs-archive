This section contains descriptions of the Spryker features grouped by capabilities.

**Capability** is a high-level description of what a certain part of a Spryker product can do. Each capability is mapped to a list of features. A **feature** is a specific aspect of a capability. For example, the *Inventory Management* capability includes the *Stock and Availability Management* and *Multiple Warehouse Stock Management* features. All the features together help to define the exact scope of a capability.
