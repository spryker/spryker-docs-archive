The Spryker Commerce OS offers a powerful and feature-rich online shopping cart that acts as a gateway for customer and order management. With the cart, your customers can easily add products to cart, organize items in the cart, and manage their purchases. Any changes the customer makes within the cart trigger an automatic sum-recalculation that is immediately applied to the total in the sum. Pre-defined taxes are applied and shown automatically. Moreover, the cart allows customers to flexibly define discount rules and to apply vouchers and coupon codes.

The main benefits of working with the cart are to create a convenient and predictable purchase experience to ensure an increase in conversion rates that is typically gained by using a feature-rich shopping cart.
