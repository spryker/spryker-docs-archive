Every e-commerce shop reaches that moment when they need to stand out among competitors in order to attract more customers. The first thing that a buyer pays attention to when visiting an online store is the interface - layout, colors, design. Creating a perfect theme for multiple stores on various occasions, for example, Hallowing sale, Black Friday sale or Christmas, has become possible with the Multi-Theme feature provided by the Spryker Commerce OS.

## If you are:

<div class="mr-container">
    <div class="mr-list-container">
        <!-- col1 -->
        <div class="mr-col">
            <ul class="mr-list mr-list-green">
                <li class="mr-title">Developer</li>
