One of the most important features in an e-commerce application is to give the customer the ability to find the products that he needs. Depending on how easy it is to find the products the customer is searching for and how relevant the search results are, the search feature is a crucial aspect for an e-commerce business.

Spryker provides a fully functional solution to integrate `Elasticsearch` as a search engine. You can extend this solution or customize it to fit for your needs.

Spryker uses [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) version 5.x.
