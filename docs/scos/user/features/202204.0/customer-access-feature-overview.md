_Customer Access_ lets store administrators define whether a certain information is visible to logged out users.

The feature lets you give your customers the ability to hide content from customers that are not logged-in to their shop. You can restrict access to prices, products, product availability, carts, and shopping lists.

A Back Office user can manage customer access in **Customer&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Customer Access**. They can hide the following content types:

* price: a customer does not see the price if they are not logged in:

* order-place-submit: after selecting **Checkout**, the customer is taken to the login page.

* add-to-cart: to be able to add an item to cart, a customer needs to log in.

* wishlist: **Add to wishlist** button is not available for a logged out user.

* shopping-list: Add to shopping list button is not available for a logged out user.

By default, all content types are hidden for a logged out user.

A developer can add more content types on a project level.

Even if the **Add to Cart** button is available, an unauthenticated customer is redirected to the login page after clicking it.

{% endinfo_block %}
