### Klarna Invoice

The option to pay after delivery makes buying quicker and easier for customers. With Klarna's Pay Later, shoppers do not need to fill out lengthy personal details or enter card numbers at the online point of sale. The transaction can be completed with only name, email and address. Consumer then have 14 days to pay the invoice.

Your customers can spread the cost of their purchases over time, at a low interest rate, giving them flexibility and increased purchasing power, which in turn boosts sales. Our unique 4-step credit application process is quick and easy, requiring minimal information and taking just seconds to complete.

## DRAFT NOTE: THIS INFO IS HIDDEN TILL WE HAVE FINAL APPROVAL FROM KLARNA AND THE DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETED.

The Klarna module provides two methods of payment:

1. [Part Payment – Flexible - Klarna](klarna-part-payment-flexible.htm)
2. [Invoice – Pay in 14 days - Klarna](klarna-invoice-pay-in-14-days.htm)

To Integrate Klarna payments, create and configure a Klarna merchant account.

We use state machines for handling and managing orders and payments. To integrate Klarna payments, a dedicated state machine should be created.

A basic and fully functional state machine is already available (KlarnaPayment01). You can use the same state machine or build a new one. In case a new state machine needs to be built, it is preferred to contact Klarna and confirm the new state machine design and functionality.

The [Klarna State Machine Commands and Conditions](klarna-state-machine.htm) trigger the operations exposed by the KlarnaFacade in order to perform the needed requests to Klarna.
