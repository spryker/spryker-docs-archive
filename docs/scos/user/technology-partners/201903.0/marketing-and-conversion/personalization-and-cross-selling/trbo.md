## Partner Information
[ABOUT TRBO](https://www.trbo.com/en/) 

Onsite. Realtime. Smart.trbo GmbH is a Munich-based technology company founded in 2013. With its cloud-based communication tool, the company enables online shops and websites to address visitors individually - onsite, in real-time and fully automated. A self-learning algorithm analyzes user behavior based on more than 50 visitor characteristics. This data then allows a targeted delivery of various layers in the design of the online presence, which demonstrably optimize the shopping experience of website visitors. For website operators this means: increased user engagement, lower bounce rates, better conversion rates, fuller shopping baskets and thus more turnover. trbo's customers include airline holidays, Buffalo, Galeria Kaufhof, L'Or√©al, Limango, Lodenfrey, Medion, mydays, Rose Bikes and Thomas Cook AG. trbo GmbH is run by Felix Schirl.
