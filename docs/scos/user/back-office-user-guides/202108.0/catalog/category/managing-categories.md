This topic describes how to manage categories:

* How to define an order according to which the products are going to be displayed.
* How to view, edit, and delete categories.

## Prerequisites

To start managing categories, go to **Catalog** > **Category**.

Each section contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Ordering products in categories

You can adjust the order in which products under the category are displayed on the Storefront.
To define the order of displaying products, set the numbers under which each product is to be displayed on the page.

For example, you have ten products assigned to your category. For five of them, there is a seasonal discount applied. So you need those to be at the top of the list.

To change the order of products:
1. In the *Categories* table, for a specific category, select **Assign Products** from the *Actions* drop-down list. You are taken to the Assign products to category page.
2. Scroll down to the *Products in this category* tab.
3. In the *Order* column, set numbers 1-5 for specific products that define the order of products in the category. For example, if you have 5 products, set the numbers from 1 to 5.

{% info_block infoBox %}

In case you have several products with the identical order number value, the ordering will be performed based on the product name attribute. The product with 0 in the Order column will be displayed at the bottom

{% endinfo_block %}

4. Click **Save**.

#### Category page template types
When you create or update categories, you select a template according to which your category (and products assigned to it ) is going to be displayed in your online store.

The following templates are used to set up your category look:

**Catalog (default)**
Select this template to display all product pages linked to the selected category. The product pages include the general product description, a price, an image, and a clickable **View** button that redirects you to the product details page.

<details><summary markdown='span'>The Catalog(default) template on the Storefront</summary>

![Catalog](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Back+Office+User+Guides/Category/Category%3A+Reference+Information/Catalog.gif)

</details>

**Catalog+Slots**
Select this template to show all product pages assigned to the selected category and a CMS Block. Depending on your design requirements, you need to set a specific CMS block and specify where it should be displayed: top, middle, or bottom.

<details><summary markdown='span'>The Catalog+CMS Block template on the Storefront</summary>

![Catalog + Slots](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Back+Office+User+Guides/Category/Category%3A+Reference+Information/Catalog%2BCms+Block.gif)

</details>

The category is in the catalog, and two CMS blocks are now displayed on the page: *Tackle Your To-Do's and Build a Space That Spurs Creativity* in the example).

**Sub Category grid**
Select the *Sub Category grid* template to create a multilevel category structure. Here you can assign an image to each subcategory.

**A template with slots**

{% info_block infoBox %}

To use a template with slots, make sure the [Templates and slots](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/cms-feature-integration.html) feature is integrated into your project.

{% endinfo_block %}

Select such a template to have slots for this category page. Slots can embed content from CMS Blocks and technology partner integrations. See [Templates and slots](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/cms-feature-overview/templates-and-slots-overview.html) for more details.

## Deleting a category

To delete a category:

1. In the *Actions* drop-down, select **Delete** next to a specific category.
You are taken to the *Delete category [Category name]* page.
On *Delete category [Category name]*, you see detailed information about everything that will be de-assigned, moved, or deleted along with that category.
2. Select the checkbox next to **Yes, I am sure** to confirm your awareness and click **Delete**.

   {% info_block infoBox %}

    Products assigned to a deleted category are de-assigned and remain in the system. If the same products are assigned to other categories, they stay assigned to those.

   {% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block infoBox %}

Child categories of the deleted category are assigned to its parent categories.

{% endinfo_block %}

**Tips and tricks**

1. To get to *Re-sort View*, for a specific category on the table view page, click *Re-sort child categories*.
2. Once in **Re-sort View**, you can drag and drop categories.
3. Once you see the correct order, click **Save**.
