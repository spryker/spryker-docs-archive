Review the [reference information](#reference-information-editing-user-groups) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Editing user groups

1. Next to the group you want to edit, click **Edit**.
2. On the **Edit Group** page, do any of the following:
    * Update the **TITLE**.
    * Remove one or more **ASSIGNED ROLES** from the group by clicking **x** next to the groups you want to remove.
    * Select one or more roles to assign.  
3. Click **Save**.

To de-assign a user from the group, in the **Users** section, click **Delete** next to the user you want to deassign.
