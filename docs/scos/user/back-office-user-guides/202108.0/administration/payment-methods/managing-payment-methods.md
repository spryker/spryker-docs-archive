The topic describes how to manage payment methods.

You can:
* View payment methods available on the Storefront.
* Edit payment methods: update payment method details, assign payment methods to store, and activate or deactivate payment methods.

## Prerequisites

To start working with payment methods, go to **Administration** > **Payment Methods**.

Review the reference information before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Viewing payment methods

To view details of a payment method, in the *Actions* column, click **View** for the payment method. On the *View Payment Method: [Payment Method name]* page, you can see the following information:

* Payment method key
* Name of the payment method
* Payment provider
* Payment method status
* Availability of the payment method per store

For the reference information, see the [Reference information: Editing payment method pages](#reference-information-editing-payment-method-pages) section.

## Editing payment method details

To edit a payment method:

1. On the *Payment Methods* page, in the *Actions* column for the payment method you want to update, click **Edit** . This redirects you to the *Edit Payment Method [Payment Method Name]* page containing two tabs: *Configuration* and *Store relation*.
2. In the *Configuration* tab, update the availability status of the payment method under **Is the Payment Method active?**:
* Select the checkbox to make the payment method available in the *Payment* step during the checkout process.
* Clear the checkbox to make the payment method unavailable in the *Payment* step during the checkout process.

4. To apply the changes, click **Save**.
