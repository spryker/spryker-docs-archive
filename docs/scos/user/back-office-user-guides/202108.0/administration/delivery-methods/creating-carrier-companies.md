The topic describes how to create a carrier company.

## Prerequisites

To start working with the carrier companies, go to **Administration** > **Delivery Methods**.

## Creating carrier companies

To create a carrier company:

1. In the top-right corner of the *Delivery Methods* page, click *+Create new carrier company*.
2. On the *Create new Carrier company* page, enter a name for the carrier company:

{% info_block warningBox %}

 The name you enter will be visible on the *Create new delivery method* page only.

{% endinfo_block %}

3. To activate the carrier company, select the **Enabled?** checkbox.
4. To complete the creation, click **Add**.

{% info_block infoBox %}

Click **List of shipment methods** to get back to the list of delivery methods. However, clicking this option **prior to** saving the changes will discard all the changes and take you to the *Delivery Methods* page.

{% endinfo_block %}

## What's next?

You have now added a new carrier company for your store.
The next step is to add a new shipment method to it. For more details, see [Creating and managing delivery methods](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/administration/delivery-methods/creating-and-managing-delivery-methods.html).
