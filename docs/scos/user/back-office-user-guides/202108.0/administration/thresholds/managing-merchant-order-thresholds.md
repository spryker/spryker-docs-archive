This topic describes how to manage [merchant order thresholds](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/checkout-feature-overview/order-thresholds-overview.html#merchant-order-thresholds).

To start working with merchant order thresholds, go to **Administration&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Merchant Relationships Threshold**.

## Prerequisites

The list of the merchant relations for which you can define thresholds is based on the merchant relations created in **Merchant&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Merchant Relations**. See [Creating a Merchant](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/marketplace/merchants/create-merchants.html) to learn more.

## Setting up Minimum Hard  Threshold

To set up a [hard minimum threshold](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/checkout-feature-overview/order-thresholds-overview.html#hard-minimum-threshold) for a merchant relation:
1. On the *Merchant relationships* page, select **Edit** next to the merchant relationship you want to set up the threshold for.
2. On the *Edit Merchant Relationship Threshold:{merchant relationship name}* page, select the **Store and Currency** you want to configure the threshold for.
3. In the *Hard Threshold* section, populate the **Enter threshold value** field.
4. In **Message**, enter a message for all the locales.
5. Scroll down the page and select **Save**.

The page refreshes, and the message about successful threshold update is displayed.

## Setting up several thresholds

To set up several threshold types:
1. Enter the fields in the sections of the thresholds you want to set up by following the respective instructions:
    * [Setting up a Hard Minimum Threshold](#setting-up-minimum-hard--threshold)
    * [Setting up a Hard Maximum Threshold](#setting-up-maximum-hard--threshold)
    * [Setting up a Soft Minimum Threshold](#setting-up-a-soft-minimum-threshold)
2. Select **Save**.

The page refreshes, and the message about successful threshold update is displayed.

**Tips and tricks**
<br>In the **Message** field, enter *{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}threshold{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}* or *{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}fee{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}* to reference the threshold name or the defined fee, respectively. When the message is rendered on the Storefront, the placeholders are replaced with the values from **Enter threshold value** and **Enter flexible fee** or **Enter fixed fee** fields.
