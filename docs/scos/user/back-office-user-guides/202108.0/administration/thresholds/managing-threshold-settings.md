The *Threshold settings* page allows you to select a tax set that is applied to the threshold fee. Thus, the tax is calculated in the same way it is calculated for the products in the cart.

## Prerequisites

To start working with threshold settings, navigate to **Administration** > **Threshold Settings**.

## Managing Threshold Settings

To configure threshold settings:
1. On the *Edit Threshold Settings* page, from the drop-down list, select the tax set that will be applied to the threshold.
2. Click **Save**.
