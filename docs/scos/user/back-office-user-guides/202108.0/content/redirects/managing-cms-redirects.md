This topic describes how to manage redirects in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

To start managing CMS redirects, go to **Content** > **Redirects**.

Review the reference information before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Editing a CMS redirect

To edit a CMS redirect:
1. On the *CMS Redirect* page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit** next to the URL you want to update.
2. On the *Edit a CMS redirect* page, you can update the following information:
    * Url
    * To URL
    * Redirect status code
3. To keep the changes, click **Save**.

{% info_block warningBox %}

If you modify the *existing* URL from which a redirect is configured, a new URL will be created and added to the list of CMS redirects.

{% endinfo_block %}

**Tips and tricks**
<br>On the *Edit a CMS redirect* page, you can do the following:
* Create a new CMS redirect by clicking **+Add CMS Redirect** in the top right corner of the page.
* Return to the list of redirects by clicking **Back to CMS** in the top right corner of the page.
