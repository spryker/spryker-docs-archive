Each section contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.


## Select a content item

Follow the steps below to select a content item you want to create:
1. On the *Overview of Content Items* page, click **Add Content Item** in the top right corner of the page.
2.  Select a content item type you want to create and follow the steps from the corresponding section:
    * [Create a banner](#create-a-banner-content-item)

    * [Create a file list](#create-a-file-list-content-item)
    * [Create a navigation](#create-a-navigation-content-item)

To learn about the content item types, see [Content item types: Module relations](/docs/scos/dev/feature-walkthroughs/{{page.version}}/content-items-feature-walkthrough/content-item-types-module-relations.html).

### Reference information: Select a content item
