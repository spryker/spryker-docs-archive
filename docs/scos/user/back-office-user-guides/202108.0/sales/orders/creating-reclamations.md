This document describes how to create [order reclamations](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/reclamations-feature-overview.html) in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

To start managing orders, go to **Sales** > **Orders**.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-creating-reclamations) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating reclamations

1. On the **Orders** page, next to the order you want to create a reclamation for, click **Claim**.
2. On the **Create reclamation** page, select one or more products you want to create a reclamation for.
3. Click **Create Reclamation**.
    The **View reclamation** page opens with the success message displayed. To learn what you can do on this page, see [Managing returns](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/sales/returns/managing-returns.html).

**Tips and tricks**
Claiming an order does not change the state of the items in the order. When a reclamation is created, a sales team member processes the order manually.
