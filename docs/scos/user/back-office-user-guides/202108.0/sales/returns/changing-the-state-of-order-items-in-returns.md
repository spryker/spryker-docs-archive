This document describes how to change the state of order items in returns. Each return is linked to the order it was created from. When you change the state of an order in a return, you change it in the linked order.

## Prerequisites

The instructions assume that there is an existing order with the **waiting for return** state.

To start working with item states in returns, do the following:
1. Go to **Sales&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Returns**.
    This opens the **Returns** page.
2. Next to the return containing the items you want to change the state of, click **View**.
    This opens the **Return Overview** page.  



Review the [reference information](#reference-information-changing-the-state-of-order-items-in-returns) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

The following table describes the states you can select for order items.

| ITEM STATE | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| Execute return | Select this state after the customer returned an item.  |
| Refund | Select this state after you refunded a returned item.|

States flow:
* **waiting for return**: the initial order stated for returns.
* When you select **Return**, the state becomes **returned**.
* When you select **Refund**, the status becomes **refunded**.

### State names

The order statuses you set here do not always have the same wording on the Storefront.
