This document describes how to delete product sets in the Back Office. Deleting a product set does not delete the products in the set. The product set stops being displayed on the Storefront, but the individual products are still displayed, and the customers can purchase them. 


To delete a product set, do the following:
1. Go to **Merchandising** > **Product Sets**.
    This opens the **Product Sets** page.
2. Next to the product set you want to delete, click **Delete**.
    This refreshes the page with a success message displayed. The product set is no longer displayed in the list.
