This topic describes how to assign and deassign filters from categories in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites


1. Create the category filters you want to assign. For instructions, see [Define filter preferences](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/202108.0/merchandising/filter-preferences/define-filter-preferences.html)
2. To start working with category filters, go to **Merchandising > Category Filters**.

## Assign filters to a category

1. In the **ROOT NODES LIST** pane, select the root category containing the category you want to add filters to.

2. In the **CATEGORY TREE** pane, select the category you want to add the filters to.
    This displays the **CATEGORY FILTERS FOR {Category name}** pane.

3. For **ADD FILTER**, start typing the name of a filter and select the needed filter from the suggested list.
4. Click **Add**.
    The filter appears in the **ACTIVE FILTERS** section.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you add all the needed filters
6. Click **Save**.
    This refreshes the page with a success message displayed. In the **CATEGORY TREE** pane, the category you've added the filters to has an *edited* icon next to it.
