This article describes how to manage customer groups.

## Prerequisites

To start working with customer groups, navigate to the **Customers** > **Customer Groups** section.

{% info_block infoBox %}

Out-of-the-box, there are no connections between customer groups and any other Back Office feature, except for the Discounts. You can set up the discount conditions to be applied to a specific customer group. See  [Discount Conditions: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/merchandising/discount/creating-vouchers.html) for more information on what the discount conditions are.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Adding a customer group

To add a customer group:
1. On the *Customer groups* page, in the top right corner, click **Add Customer Group**.
On the **Add a Customer Group** page there are two tabs: *General Information* and *Customers*.
3. In the *General Information* tab, enter the name and description for your customer group.
4. Click **Next** to proceed to the *Customers* tab, or just click on it.
5. In the *Customers* tab, select the checkboxes in the _select_ column for the customers you want to assign to this group.
    You can select as many customers as needed.
5. Click **Save**.

## Editing a customer group

To edit a customer group:
1. On the *Customer groups* page, click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column for the specific group you want to edit.
2. Update the needed attributes:
    * To unassign a user from the group, scroll down to the *Assigned customers* table and clear the checkbox on the left of the user you want to unassign.
    * To reassign all customers, click **De-select All**.
3.  Click **Save**.

## Viewing customer groups

To view a customer group, in the _Actions_ column for a specific customer group you want to view, click **View**.

On this page, you can:
* Click **Edit Customer Group** in the top right corner and initiate the editing flow.
* Click **View** in the _Actions_ column for a specific customer assigned to this group. This will take you to the *View Customer* page (the **Customers** > **Customers** section).
