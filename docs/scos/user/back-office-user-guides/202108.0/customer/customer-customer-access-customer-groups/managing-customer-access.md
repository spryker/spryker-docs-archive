The *Customer Access* page allows you to define what information not logged-in to online store customers.

## Prerequisites

To start defining specific restrictions for not logged-in customers, go to **Customers** > **Customer Access**.

## Defining customer access

To define the restrictions:
1. In the *Customer Access* section, select one of the following content types in the *Hide the following information from not logged in users* pane:
    * **Price**: if selected, no prices will be shown to not logged-in customers.
    * **Can place an order**: if selected, the not logged-in user is not able to place in order.
    * **Add to Cart**: if selected, there will be no **Add to Cart** option displayed.
    * **Wishlist**: if selected, no **Wishlist** option is available.
    * **Shopping List**: if selected, no **Add to Shopping List** option is available.

{% info_block errorBox "B2B Only" %}

This option is selected by default and cannot be deselected.

{% endinfo_block %}

2. Click **Save** to save the changes.
