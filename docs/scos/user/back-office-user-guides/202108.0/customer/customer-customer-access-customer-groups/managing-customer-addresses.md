This topic describes how to manage customer addresses and view orders.

## Prerequisites

To start working with customer details, go to **Customers** > **Customers**.

Each section contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Adding customer addresses

To add a new address:
1. On the *View Customer* page, in the top right corner, click **Add new Address**.
2. Enter the new address for the customer.
3. Click **Save**.

By default, the first address added to a customer account is considered both for billing and for shipping.

If you need to have a different billing address or shipping address, do the following:
1. Create an address as described above.
2. Go to the *Edit Customer* page either from the *Customers* page or from the *View Customer* page.
3. Choose one address to be the billing address and one address to be the shipping address.
4. Click **Save**.

### Reference information: Adding customer addresses

The following table describes the attributes you enter and select when adding a new customer address.

| ATTRIBUTE| DESCRIPTION |
