The **Product Reviews** section of the Back Office is mostly used by the Customer Service. 

This section allows approving, rejecting, and deleting the reviews sent by shop users. 

{% info_block infoBox %}
This is how the Customer Service deals with the customers' reviews to create a list of the approved (or rejected
{% endinfo_block %} product reviews.)
