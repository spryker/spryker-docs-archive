This topic describes how you create scheduled prices.
***
For example, you want to set up a promotion for Valentine's Day beforehand so that:

* you do not have to switch prices manually on the day of the promotion
* prices switch to the specified ones automatically on the starting date of the promotion
* prices switch back automatically on the last day of the promotion

Instead of changing prices manually on the starting day of the promotion, you can create a price schedule called, e.g. **Valentine's day prices**. To do that you need to import a file with predefined dates and prices.

***

**To create a price schedule:**

1. Create a file with predefined product price schedules. See [Scheduled Prices: Reference information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/scheduled-prices/references/scheduled-prices-reference-information.html).
2. Enter and select the attributes for your price schedule. See [Scheduled Prices: Reference information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/scheduled-prices/references/scheduled-prices-reference-information.html).
3. Click **Browse** and select the file you've prepared in step 1.
4. Click **Import your CSV file**.
5. After being redirected to the _Import dry run_ page, check whether there are incorrect entries in your file in the **Errors found inside your file** section.

  {% info_block infoBox %}

  You can correct the errors in your file and re-import it on the same page.

  {% endinfo_block %}

1. Check if the successfully imported price schedules are correct in the Row processed with success section.

2. If you are satisfied with the results, in the Publish the scheduled prices section, click Publish to apply the price schedules.
***

**Tips and tricks**
* If you leave the _Import dry run_ page without publishing the imported price schedules, they do not get deleted. However, you won't be able to return to that page unless you import the file once again.
* You can check current price schedules of each product in **Products** section >**Edit Product** page > **Scheduled Prices** tab.
