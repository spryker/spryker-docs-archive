The **Scheduled Prices** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Product Catalog Managers.
***
This section is designed to import predefined product price schedules which are to be applied to existing products automatically.

The primary uses of scheduled prices are to automate price changes and enable Back Office users to prepare for major events beforehand.

{% info_block infoBox %}
This is how a Product Catalog Manager can set up price product schedules for a defined list of products. The imported product prices will be applied on the specified dates. Also, you can import several files with price schedules for the same product and both schedules will be applied.
