This topic contains the reference information that you need to know when working in the **Users Control > Users** section.
***
## User Page
On the **Users** page, you see the following:
* Users' emails and first and last names
* Last login date and status
* Identifier of an agent user
* Actions that you can perform
***
## Agent User

While creating or editing a user, you can make a specific user to be an agent. 

This is very helpful for Customer Service and Sales departments. 

**Who is an agent user?**
This is a user that can do the same actions in the online store as a regular buyer.

**Why this option is needed?**
Let's pretend that there is a customer that needs assistance with his order. He needs a store representative to find the needed items in the catalog and submit an order on his behalf. This is exactly what an agent can do.

**How this can be done?**
An agent user goes to Yves using _/agent/login_ at the end of the online store URL and logins with their Back Office credentials. 

In the **Search** field on the top, he searches for the customer email. Once found, clicks **Confirm** on the right. 

Since now he can perform the same actions as a regular customer. Once all needed actions are done and the order is placed, he clicks **End Customer Assistance**.
