***
Spryker's Navigation allows creating complex navigation elements with CMS pages, categories, and any other relevant links. You can even group certain items together into secondary menus and customize their look and feel. With Navigation, you can build and manage as many navigation elements as needed. All navigation elements can have their own nested structure of navigation nodes. 
You can use navigation elements to build your store's main navigation, footer links for backlinks, etc.
