The topic describes how to create a category and a product details page by assigning CMS blocks to those pages.
***
This might be useful if you decided to hold a marketing campaign, a set of activities (sales, discounts) geared towards some event or add a banner to the page. In this case, you can embed a CMS block containing the marketing content that will be displayed only on category or product detail pages you specify.
***
To start creating the category or product detail pages, navigate to the **Content Management > Blocks** section.
***

## Assigning a Block to a Category Page

To create a category page:
1. On the **Overview of CMS Blocks** page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit Block** next to the block you would like to use to create a page.
  {% info_block warningBox %}
  
  You can only add existing, active, and not expired block. If the block has not been created yet, see the [Creating a CMS Block](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/content/blocks/creating-cms-blocks.html) article first.

  {% endinfo_block %}

2. On the **Edit CMS Block: Block ID** page that opens, put a cursor on the container where the CMS block will be displayed depending on your design requirements:
   * Categories: top
   * Categories: middle
   * Categories: bottom

4. To keep the changes, click **Save**.
