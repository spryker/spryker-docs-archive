CMS widget is a content snippet you can add and edit in the WYSIWYG editor. As a shop administrator, you can use them to display charts, product lists, or product groups to be shown on one or more pages.

With CMS widgets, you can display the page content that can be, for instance, adjustable to some specific marketing events or insert media files to be downloaded by your site visitors.

You can download this [guide](https://cdn.document360.io/9fafa0d5-d76f-40c5-8b02-ab9515d3e879/Images/Documentation/cms_content_widgets.pdf) to learn more about procedures that can be performed on the content widgets.

Keep in mind that starting with the version **201907.0**, the content widget menu has been disabled. However, you can use content items widgets instead. See [Content Item Widgets](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/201907.0/content/content-items/content-item-widgets.html) to learn how to work with them.
