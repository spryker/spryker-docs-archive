The Order Matrix page displays the information about ordered items.

When you navigate to the **Overview of Order Matrix** page (**Sales > Order Matrix**), you see the following information:
* The statuses of the ordered items
* The number of items with a specific status
![Order Matrix](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Back+Office+User+Guides/Sales/Order+Matrix/order+matrix.png)

The numbers are hyperlinked. If selected, you will be redirected to the **Overview of Orders** page. The table will display only the order(s) that contains the items with the selected status.

_For example_, you have five items with the **exported** status. When you click _5_ on the **Overview of Order Matrix** page, you will see the **Overview of Orders** page filtered by orders with the exported items only.
