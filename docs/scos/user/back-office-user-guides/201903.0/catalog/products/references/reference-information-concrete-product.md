The following tables describe the attributes that you use when creating and editing concrete and abstract products.
{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

The set of tabs for Create and Edit pages, as well as for abstract and concrete products, is different. Hence the additional columns with identifiers are added for your convenience.
