Product Sets let customers shop for special sets of products that can be manually curated based on any characteristic of the products you wish.
Multiple products can be offered as a set so that the customer can add them to cart with a single click. Each set has its own URL and all sets can be shown on a separate section in the catalog.

* Dedicated catalog for product sets with adjustable order of the sets by the weight parameter
* Product set page with a variant selector (for products with multiple variants), SEO metadata, and images per set
* Place product sets in CMS placeholders
