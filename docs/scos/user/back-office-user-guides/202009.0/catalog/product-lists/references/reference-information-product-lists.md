This topic describes the reference information for creating and managing the product lists.
***
## Overview of Product Lists page

On the **Overview of Product Lists** page, you see the following information:

* The autogenerated product list ID
* Product list title and type (with Blacklist or Whitelist)
* The actions that you can perform with each specific product list (Edit List, Remove List)
![product-list-overview-page](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Back+Office+User+Guides/Products/Product+Lists/product-list-overview-page.png) 

By default, the last created product list goes on top of the table. However, you can sort and search the list of product lists.

All columns with headers having arrows in the **List of Product Lists** table are sortable. You can list the table by any available column except for the _Actions_.
