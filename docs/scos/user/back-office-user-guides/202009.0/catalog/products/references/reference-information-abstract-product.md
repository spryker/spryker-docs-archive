The topic describes the reference information for working with abstract products.

The attributes for Create and Edit pages, as well as for abstract and concrete products, are different. We added additional columns to identify what case an attribute is relevant for.

## Variants tab
{% info_block warningBox "Product bundles" %}
When you create a product bundle, a single product variant is created automatically. Skip the configuration in this tab
{% endinfo_block %}
* In the **Variants** tab, you can see [super attributes](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-feature-overview/product-feature-overview.html#super-attributes) that derive from **Catalog** > **Attributes**. See [Creating product attributes](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/attributes/creating-product-attributes.html) to learn how to create them.
* You can select as many super attributes as you need and define one or more values for them. For each product attribute value you select, a product variant is created. After creating the abstract product, you can create new product variants based on the super attributes you select when creating the abstract product. 
* While editing the abstract product/product bundle, you will see a table that displays the product variants that exist for this abstract product. From this page, you can View, Edit, and Manage Attributes for the product variant.
