This document describes how to create user groups.

## Prerequisites

1. If you are new to the **Users** section, you might want to start with [Best practices: Managing users and their permissions with roles and groups](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/best-practices-managing-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).
2. Create at least one user role. For instructions, see [Creating user roles](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/managing-user-roles/creating-user-roles.html).
3. To start working with user groups, go to **Users** > **User Groups**.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-creating-user-groups) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating groups

1. Click **Create Group**.
2. On the **Create new Group**, page enter a **TITLE**.
3. Select one or more **ASSIGNED ROLES**.
4. Click **Save**.
    This opens the **Edit Group** page with the success message displayed.


## Reference information: Creating user groups

| ATTRIBUTE | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| TITLE | Unique identifier of the user group. You will use it to identify the group when creating users. |
| ASSIGNED ROLES | The user roles to be assigned to the group. For role creating instructions, see [Creating user roles](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/managing-user-roles/creating-user-roles.html). |


**Tips and tricks**
The **USERS** pane is empty. After you create a user and assign it to this group, the user will be displayed in the pane.
