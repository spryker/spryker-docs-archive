This document describes how to create users in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

1. If you are new to the **Users** section, you might want to start with [Best practices: Managing users and their permissions with roles and groups](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/best-practices-managing-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).
2. Create at least one user group. For instructions, see [Creating user groups](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/managing-user-groups/creating-user-groups.html).
3. To start working with users, go to **Users** > **Users**.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-creating-users) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating users

1. On the **Users** page, click **Add New User**.
2. On the **Create new User** page, enter an **E-MAIL**.
3. Enter a **PASSWORD**.
4. For **REPEAT PASSWORD**, enter the same password once again.
5. Enter a **FIRST NAME**.
6. Enter a **LAST NAME**.
7. For **ASSIGNED GROUPS**, select one or more user groups you want to assign this user to.
8. If you want this user to be an agent, select **THIS USER IS AN AGENT**.
9. Select an **INTERFACE LANGUAGE**.
10. Click **Create**.

This opens the **Users** page with the success message displayed. The created user is displayed in the list.

## Reference information: Creating users

The following table describes the attributes you enter and select when creating roles:
