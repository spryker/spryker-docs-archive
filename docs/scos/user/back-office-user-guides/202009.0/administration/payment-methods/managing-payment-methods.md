The topic describes how to manage payment methods

You can :
* View payment methods available on the Storefront
* Edit payment methods: update payment method details, assign payment methods to store, and/or (de)activate payment methods


To start working with payment methods, go to **Administration** > **Payment Management** > **Payment Methods**.
***
## Viewing Payment Methods
To view the payment method details, click **View** for the payment method in the *Actions* column. On the **View Payment Method: [Payment Method name]** page, you can see the following information:

* Payment method key
* Name of the payment method
* Payment provider
* Payment method status
* Availability of the payment method per store



## Editing Payment Method Details
To edit a payment method:

1. On the **Payment Methods** page, click **Edit** in the *Actions* column for the payment method you want to update. This will redirect you to the **Edit Payment Method [Payment Method Name]** page containing two tabs: **Configuration** and **Store relation**.

2. In the **Configuration** tab, update the availability status of the payment method under **Is the Payment Method active?**:
* Select the checkbox to make the payment method available in the *Payment* step during the checkout process
* Clear the checkbox to make the payment method unavailable in the *Payment* step during the checkout process.

4. To apply the changes, click **Save**.
