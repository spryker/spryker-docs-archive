The following table describes the attributes used to configure thresholds:

| Attribute |Description|
| --- | --- |
|**Store and Currency** | Defines the store to which the threshold is applied and the currency in which it is displayed. |
|**Enter threshold value**| Depending on the threshold type, defines the value that should be reached or not reached.|
|**Message** |A short message that informs the customer about the threshold conditions. For example, _You should add items for {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}threshold{% raw %}}}{% endraw %} to pass a recommended threshold. You can't proceed with checkout._ <br><br> Enter {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}threshold{% raw %}}}{% endraw %} or {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}fee{% raw %}}}{% endraw %} to reference the threshold name or the defined fee respectively. When the message is rendered on the Storefront, the placeholders are replaced with the values from **Enter threshold value** and **Enter flexible fee** or **Enter fixed fee** fields. |
| **Enter fixed fee** | Adds this value to cart if the threshold is not reached. |
| **Enter flexible fee** | A percentage of an order's sub-total that is added to cart if the threshold is not reached.|
