## Editing a CMS Redirect
**To edit a CMS redirect:**

2. On the **Edit a CMS redirect** page, you can update the following information:

    * Url
    * To URL
    * Redirect status code
3. To keep the changes, click **Save**.

{% info_block infoBox %}

{% endinfo_block %} to learn more information about the attributes you need to enter.)

{% info_block warningBox %}
If you modify the **existing** URL from which a redirect is configured, a new URL will be created and added to the list of CMS redirects.
{% endinfo_block %}
