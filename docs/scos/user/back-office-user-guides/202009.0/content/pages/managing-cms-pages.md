This article describes how to manage CMS pages.

To start managing CMS pages, got to **Content Management** > **Pages**.
***
## Previewing CMS Pages
If you would like to see how your page will look like before you publish it, you can preview it in your browser.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

To be able to preview a draft of your page, you need to link your Zed account to an Yves account.

{% endinfo_block %}

**To link a Zed customer to an Yves customer:**

1. Navigate to **Users Control** > **User**.
2. On the **Users list** page, click **Assign Customers to User: Zed account e-mail** in the _Actions_ column. This will take you to the **Assign Customers** page.
3. Select a user you would like to assign to your Zed account.
{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

Keep in mind that a customer **cannot** be assigned to multiple users at a time.

{% endinfo_block %}
1. To keep the changes, click **Save**.

After you linked your Yves customer to your Zed user, make sure that you are logged in to Zed with your Zed account and logged in to Yves with the assigned customer account.

Now, we can proceed with the steps to preview a draft of your page.

You can use the Preview mode from either the **Overview of CMS Pages** page or the **Edit Placeholders** editor.

**To preview a draft of your CMS page from the Overview of CMS Pages page:**
1.On the **Overview of CMS Pages** page, click **View** and select **Preview** from the drop-down list next to the page whose draft you want to view.
2. The page in the Preview mode will be opened in a new tab of your browser.

**To preview a draft of your CMS page from the Edit Placeholders editor**, see the [Editing Placeholders](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/content/pages/editing-cms-pages.html#selecting-the-edit-gt-placeholders-option) section.


## Publishing a Page
Until now we have created a draft of the page and added some content. Thus, to keep changes and display them on the shop website, you need to publish them.

You can publish your page either from the **Overview of CMS Pages** page or from the **Edit Placeholders** editor.

**To publish a page from the Overview of CMS Pages page:**
1. On the **Overview of CMS Pages** page, click **Publish** in the _Actions_ column.
2. The page will be successfully published.

**To publish a page from the Edit Placeholders editor**, see the [Editing Placeholders](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/content/pages/editing-cms-pages.html#selecting-the-edit-gt-placeholders-option) section.

## Viewing a Page

## Activating and Deactivating Pages
