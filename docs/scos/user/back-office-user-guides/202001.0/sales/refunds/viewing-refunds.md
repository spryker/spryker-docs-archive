If a customer changes their mind about an order, you can give him/her a refund for the order.
***

To view the refunds, navigate to the **Sales > Refunds** section.
***

This page just displays the information so no actual actions can be done there.

On the **Refunds** page you see the **List of refunds** table that contains the following information:

| Value |Description  |
| --- | --- |
| **Refind Id**| The ID of a specific refund. |
|**Sales Order Id**  |The ID of the order that derives from the **Sales > Orders** section. |
| **Refund date** |The date when a specific refund has been created.|
| **Amount** |The amount of money to refund. This amount value derives from Item Total in **Sales > Orders**.|

**How refunds appear in the Refunds section?**

When a customer receives the items they ordered, they may encounter issues with some or all of them. In this case, a customer contacts the sales department asking them for a refund. A sales department representative navigates to the **Sales > Orders** section and opens the order. They change the status of order item (or all items) to **return** and then to **refund**. Once this is done, an appropriate record appears in the **Refunds** section.
