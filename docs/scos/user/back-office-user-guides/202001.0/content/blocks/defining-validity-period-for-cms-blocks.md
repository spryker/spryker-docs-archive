This topic describes the steps of setting up the validity period for CMS blocks.
***

The validity period is a period of time during which a CMS block will be visible in the online store. Thus, you will not have to return to CMS block settings to remove it from the page because there is no need in its usage any longer. For instance, this may be important to use when holding marketing or promotion campaigns or adding a banner dedicated to special events.
***

**To define the validity period:**
1. On the **Overview of CMS Blocks** page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit Block** next to the block you want to specify valid dates for.
2. On the **Edit CMS Block: Block ID** page that opens, enter **Valid from** and **Valid to** dates during which your CMS block will be available on the page.
3. To keep the changes, click **Save**.
