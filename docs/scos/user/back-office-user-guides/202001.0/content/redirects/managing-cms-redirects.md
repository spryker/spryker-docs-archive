## Editing a CMS Redirect
**To edit a CMS redirect:**

2. On the **Edit a CMS redirect** page, you can update the following information:
   - Url
   - To URL
   - Redirect status code
3. To keep the changes, click **Save**.

  {% info_block infoBox %}

  See [CMS Redirects: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/content/redirects/references/cms-redirects-references.html) to learn more information about the attributes you need to enter.

  {% endinfo_block %}

  Keep in mind that if you modify the **existing** URL from which a redirect is configured, a new URL will be created and added to the list of CMS redirects.

  {% endinfo_block %}
