Products are the core of your shop and deserve a great deal of your attention, as selling them is the whole reason behind your online store. Therefore, it is essential to know how to manage the products you present to your customers. The whole product management, from product creation to stock and product reviews management, is done in the **Back Office > Products** section.
***
Product management section is split into smaller sub-sections. Those sub-sections are used to present a flow and the logical order of actions in the following format:
* **Attributes**, which should exist prior to the product setup
* _B2B only_: **Packaging Types** (packaging types are imported)
* **Product Labels**, which is an optional setup step
* **Product Options**
* **Products** itself
* **Product Sets**
* **Product Bundles**, which is not an independent sub-section but a part of Products
* **Product Barcodes**, which are created automatically once the product is created
* **Product Relations**
* **Product Reviews**, which can be only approved or rejected as they come from the customers for each specific item in the online store
* **Availability**, which can be used continuously
* _B2B only_: **Product Lists**, which are not product-related in terms of usage as they are created based on the contract conditions (merchant relations)
