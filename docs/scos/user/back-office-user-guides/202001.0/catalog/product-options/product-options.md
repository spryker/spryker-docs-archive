The Product Options feature is meant for creating and managing product additions. With this feature, online stores can offer their customers an opportunity to add some additional item or service to their products during the product purchase.

Product options are product additions that allow a Back Office user to create and add product additions for an abstract product in the Back Office. Warranty, insurance, or gift wrappings for products are examples of product options you can easily manage in your Spryker shop application.

Product options are connected to abstract products. They appear in groups that can have multiple product option values. Each product option value contains a unique identifier and price configuration. On the group level, a tax set is attached to the product option values. Also, each option group can be linked to many different abstract products and vice versa.
