This topic contains the reference information that you need to know when working in the **Category** section.
***
## Categories Page

In the **Category** section, you see the following:
* Category key, category name, and the parent category to which a specific one is assigned
* Identifiers for Active, Visible and Searchable
* Template type
* Actions that you can do on a specific category
***
## Category Page Template Types

When you create or update the categories, you select a template according to which your category (and the assigned to it products) is going to be displayed in your online store.

The following templates are used to set up your category look:

* **Catalog (default)**
<br>Select this template if you want to display all product pages linked to the selected category. The product pages include the general product description, a price, an image, and a clickable **View** button that will redirect you to the product details page. See how the **Catalog** template looks on Yves.

* **Catalog+CMS Block**
<br>Select this template if you want to show all product pages assigned to the selected category and a CMS Block. Depending on your design requirements, you need to set a specific CMS block and to specify where it should be displayed: top, middle, or bottom. See Content Management topics for more information.

See how the **Catalog+CMS Block** template looks on Yves.

The category is in the catalog, and two CMS blocks are now displayed on the page: _Tackle Your To-Do's_ and _Build a Space That Spurs Creativity_ in the example).

* **CMS Block**
<br>Select this template if you want to display only a specific CMS block on the category page. In this case, choose a position of the CMS block on the page. See how the **CMS Block** template looks on Yves.

Instead of navigating you to the catalog view, once such a category is selected you see the CMS block.

* **Sub Category grid**
<br> Select if you want to create a multilevel category structure. Here you can assign an image to each subcategory.
    See how the **Sub Category grid** template looks on Yves.

**A template with slots**

To use such a template, the Templates & Slots feature should be [integrated](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/cms-feature-integration.html) into your project.

Select such a template if you want this category page to have slots. Slots can embed content from CMS Blocks and technology partner integrations. See [Templates & Slots Feature Overview](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/cms-feature-overview/templates-and-slots-overview.html)  for more details.
