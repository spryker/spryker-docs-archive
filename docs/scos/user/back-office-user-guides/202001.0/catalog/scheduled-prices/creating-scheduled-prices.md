This topic describes how you create scheduled prices.
To start working with scheduled prices, navigate to **Prices > Scheduled Prices**.

For example, you want to set up a promotion for Valentine's Day beforehand so that:
* you do not have to switch prices manually on the day of the promotion
* prices switch to the specified ones automatically on the starting date of the promotion
* prices switch back automatically on the last day of the promotion

Instead of changing prices manually on the starting day of the promotion, you can create a price schedule called,  e.g. **Valentine's day prices**. To do that you need to import a file with predefined dates and prices.
***

**To create a price schedule:**
1. Create a CSV file with predefined product price schedules. See [Scheduled Prices: Reference information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/scheduled-prices/references/scheduled-prices-reference-information.html).
2. Enter and select the attributes for your price schedule. See [Scheduled Prices: Reference information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/scheduled-prices/references/scheduled-prices-reference-information.html).
3. Click **Browse** and select the file you've prepared in step 1.
4. Click **Import your CSV file**.
5. Once redirected to the _Import dry run_ page, check whether there are incorrect entries in your file in the **Errors found inside your file** section.

{% info_block infoBox %}

If needed, you can [edit the imported scheduled prices](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/scheduled-prices/managing-scheduled-prices.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

5. Check if the successfully imported price schedules are correct in the **Row processed with success** section.

6. If you are satisfied with the results, in the **Publish the scheduled prices** section, click **Publish** to apply the price schedules.

**Tips and tricks**
* If you leave the _Import dry run_ page without publishing the imported price schedules, they do not get deleted. However, you won't be able to return to that page unless you import the file once again.
* You can check current price schedules of each product in **Products** section >**Edit Product** page > **Scheduled Prices** tab.
