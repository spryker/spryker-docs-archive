Product Lists section in Back Office is designed to set specific restrictions for the **B2B** customers.
***

**This feature is used for B2B purposes only as the restrictions are set based on merchant relations.**
***

This is a page where Back Office users can define product restrictions for a specified set of products by adding them to an appropriate product list.
The product restrictions work on the basis of whitelist/blacklist lists:
* Whitelist: Products included in this product list type are always available for the customers.
* Blacklist: Products included in this product list type are hidden from the customer view.
In other words, blacklists and whitelists are the conditions under which a product (a list of products) is displayed in the store.
If the product is blacklisted, a shopper is not able to see it and search for it.
If a specific product (or a list of products) is whitelisted, the shopper is able to see and search for only this specific product (list of products). The others are hidden from the view.
