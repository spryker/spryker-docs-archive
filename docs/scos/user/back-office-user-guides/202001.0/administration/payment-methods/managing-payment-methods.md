The topic describes the procedures you can perform on payment methods:

* View payment methods available on the Storefront
* Edit payment methods: update payment method details, assign payment methods to store, and/or (de)activate payment methods
***

To start managing payment methods, navigate to the **Administration > Payment Management > Payment Methods** section.
***

## Viewing Payment Methods

To view the payment method details, click **View** for the payment method in the *Actions* column. On the **View Payment Method: [Payment Method name]** page, you can see the following information:

* Payment method key
* Name of the payment method
* Payment provider
* Payment method status
* Availability of the payment method per store

See Payment Methods: Reference Information <!-- link --> for more details on the attributes you see on the page.

## Editing Payment Method Details

To edit a payment method:

1. On the **Payment Methods** page, click **Edit** in the *Actions* column for the payment method you want to update. This will redirect you to the **Edit Payment Method [Payment Method Name]** page containing two tabs: **Configuration** and **Store relation**.
2. In the **Configuration** tab, update the availability status of the payment method under **Is the Payment Method active?**:
   - Select the checkbox to make the payment method available in the *Payment* step during the checkout process
   - Clear the checkbox to make the payment method unavailable in the *Payment* step during the checkout process.
