This topic describes the procedures for managing thresholds per merchant relation.
***
To start working with Merchant Relationships thresholds, navigate to the **Threshold > Merchant relationships** section.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

Thresholds for merchant relationships do work only for a certain merchant relationship that was created in the **Merchant Relations** section in the Back Office.

{% endinfo_block %}

This type of threshold is managed by editing a specific merchant relation.

The list of available merchant relations in the Merchant relationships table is build based on the relations that were previously added to the **Merchant > Merchant Relations** section in the Back Office. So those need to be created you can proceed to the minimum order value setup.
Every merchant relationship can have both hard and soft threshold. The thresholds need to be configured for every store and currency.
