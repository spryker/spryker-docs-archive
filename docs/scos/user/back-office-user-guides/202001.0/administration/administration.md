The **Administration** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Spryker Admins.

This section is designed to reflect data about stores and warehouses configuration. It is a source of information for management that helps to either approve the configuration or identify the need for updates.

**Standardized flow of actions for a Spryker Admin**

{% info_block infoBox %}

This is how the data about stores and warehouses is communicated between different teams inside and outside of Spryker Back Office.

{% endinfo_block %}

This section was designed as a reference location. Thus, no actual actions can be performed there. It is utilized as a quick overview of existing stores and warehouses.
