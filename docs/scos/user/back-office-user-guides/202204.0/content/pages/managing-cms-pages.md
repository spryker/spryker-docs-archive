This article describes how to manage CMS pages.

## Prerequisites

1. To preview CMS pages as a specific customer, [assign the customer to your user](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/users/managing-users/assigning-customers-to-users.html).

2. To start managing CMS pages, got to **Content&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Pages**.

Each section contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Previewing CMS pages

If you would like to see how your page will look before you publish it, you can preview it in your browser.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

To preview a draft of your page, link your Zed account to an Yves account.

{% endinfo_block %}

To link a Zed customer to an Yves customer:
1. Navigate to **Users Control&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> User**.
2. On the *Users list* page, click **Assign Customers to User: Zed account e-mail** in the _Actions_ column. This will take you to the *Assign Customers* page.
3. Select a user you would like to assign to your Zed account.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

Keep in mind that a customer *cannot* be assigned to multiple users at a time.

{% endinfo_block %}

4. To keep the changes, click **Save**.

After you linked your Yves customer to your Zed user, make sure that you are logged in to Zed with your Zed account and logged in to Yves with the assigned customer account.

Now, you can proceed with the steps to preview a draft of your page.
