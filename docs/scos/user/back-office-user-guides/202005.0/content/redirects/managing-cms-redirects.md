This topic describes how to manage redirects in the Back Office.

To start managing CMS redirects, go to **Content Management** > **Redirects**.

## Editing a CMS Redirect
**To edit a CMS redirect:**
1. On the **CMS Redirect** page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit** next to the URL you want to update.
2. On the **Edit a CMS redirect** page, you can update the following information:

    * Url
    * To URL
    * Redirect status code
3. To keep the changes, click **Save**.

{% info_block infoBox %}
See [CMS Redirects: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/content/redirects/references/cms-redirects-references.html
{% endinfo_block %} to learn more information about the attributes you need to enter.)

{% info_block warningBox %}
If you modify the **existing** URL from which a redirect is configured, a new URL will be created and added to the list of CMS redirects.
{% endinfo_block %}

**Tips and tricks**
On the **Edit a CMS redirect** page, you can do the following:

* Create a new CMS redirect by clicking **+Add CMS Redirect** in the top right corner of the page.
* Return to the list of redirects by clicking **Back to CMS** in the top right corner of the page.

1. Navigate to the **Content Management > Redirects**. 
2. On the **CMS Redirect** page in the _Actions_ column, click **Delete** next to the URL you want to delete.
