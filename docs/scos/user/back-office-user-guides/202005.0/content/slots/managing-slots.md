***
## Activating and Deactivating Slots
You can activate or deactivate a slot.  The embedded content will either be visible or invisible in the Storefront pages.

To activate a slot, click **Activate** in the *Actions* column in the **List of Slots for [name] Template** section. This will change the status to **Active**. The content of this slot will be displayed in the corresponding Storefront page(s).

To deactivate a slot, click **Deactivate** in the *Actions* column in the **List of Slots for [name] Template** section. This will change the status to **Inactive**. The content of this slot will be removed from the corresponding Storefront page(s).

## Assigning CMS Blocks to Slots
You can assign CMS blocks to a slot selected in the **List of Slots for [name] Template**. The content of assigned CMS blocks is displayed in the the corresponding Storefront page(s). If there are no CMS blocks with content that you can assign, see [Creating a CMS Block](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/content/blocks/creating-cms-blocks.html).

To assign a CMS block to a slot:

1. In the **List of Slots for [name] Template**, click on the row of the slot you wish to assign CMS blocks to;
2. Open the drop-down menu in the **List of assigned Blocks for [name] Slot**;
3. Select a CMS block and click **+Add**;
{% info_block warningBox %} 
Repeat Step 2 for each CMS block that you want to assign.
{% endinfo_block %}
{% info_block infoBox %} 
* The **+Add** button is not active until a CMS block is selected.
* In the drop-down menu, start typing the name of a CMS block to filter the list.
* You can only add one CMS block at a time. When you click on a CMS block in the drop-down menu to select it, the drop-down menu closes with the selected CMS Block shown in the drop-down field. If you do not click  **+Add** and select another CMS Block, the previous CMS Block is replaced with the new one. If you click **+Add** after replacing one CMS block with another, only the last selected CMS block is added.
* Newly added CMS blocks are placed on top of the **List of assigned Blocks for [name] Slot**.
* You can add an inactive CMS block to a slot. The content of the inactive CMS block won't be displayed until the CMS block is activated.
{% endinfo_block %}
4. Click **Save** to assign all the selected CMS blocks to the slot.

The order of the assigned CMS blocks in the **List of assigned Blocks for [name] Slot** reflects the order of CMS blocks displayed in the corresponding Storefront page(s). See Changing the Position of CMS Blocks to define the desired order.

## Changing the Order of CMS Blocks

2. In the *Actions* column of the **List of assigned Blocks for [name] Slot**,
    - to move a CMS block one position up, click **Move Up**. This will swap this slot with the one located above. The content of the CMS blocks will be swapped respectively in the corresponding page(s).
    - to move a CMS block one position down, click **Move Down**. This will swap this slot with the one located below. The content of the CMS blocks will be swapped respectively in the corresponding page(s).

{% info_block infoBox %} 
If there is only one CMS block assigned to a slot, Move Up and Move Down actions are not available.
{% endinfo_block %}
