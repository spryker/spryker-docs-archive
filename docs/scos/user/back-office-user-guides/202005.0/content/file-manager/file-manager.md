The File Manager section in Spryker Back Office is mostly used by the Marketing Content Manager to download different types of files that are going to be used in the **Content > Content Items** section to create **File List** content items.

In the File Manager section, a Marketing Content Manager can do the following:

* upload the files
* build the file tree structure by creating file directories and changing their order
* review the files available in the system
