This article describes how to add product alternatives for a product.

To start working with product alternatives, go to **Catalog > Products**.

The product alternative is displayed on the Product Details page. This allows your customer to select another item with similar characteristics. It can also help your customers make a purchase if the product they initially review is out of stock.
For example, if smartphone 1 is out of stock, or discontinued, you can set smartphone 2 to be its alternative.
***
To set product alternatives for a product, do the following:
1. On the **Edit Concrete Product** page, switch to the Product Alternatives tab. 
2. To add product alternatives, enter _Product Name_ or its _SKU_ in the **Add Product Alternative by Name** or **SKU** field.
    You can add multiple alternative products.

4. Click **Save**.

Once the setup is completed, the page is refreshed to display the table with the alternative products you have added. 
To remove any alternative product, click **Remove** in the _Actions_ column.

**Tips and tricks**
The product alternatives will be displayed on the concrete product page only when it is out of stock or discontinued. In any other case, no alternatives are displayed. However, for each product added as an alternative one, a **Replacement for** section is going to be displayed:

In addition to the alternatives section, a dynamic label is assigned to the product for which the alternatives are set up.
