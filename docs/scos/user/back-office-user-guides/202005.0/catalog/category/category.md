The **Category** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Product Catalog Managers. 
This section is designed to build a logical structure of products by assigning them to specific categories according to one or many common criteria. 
The primary uses of categories are to develop dynamic category pages and enhance store's search and filter capabilities.
