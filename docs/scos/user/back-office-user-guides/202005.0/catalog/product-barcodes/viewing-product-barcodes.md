Nowadays, B2B businesses face extraordinary challenges as more and more consumers are making comparisons of various e-commerce applications. To stay on top of the industry trends, improve customer experience and increase sales, every business must innovate with a deep understanding of their customerâ€™s physical, emotional, and financial needs and triggers.

Barcodes are often overlooked as a way to cut costs and save time. A valuable and viable choice for businesses looking to improve efficiency and reduce overhead, barcodes are both cost-effective and reliable. Both inexpensive and user-friendly, barcodes provide an indispensable tool for tracking a variety of data, from pricing to inventory. The ultimate result of a comprehensive barcoding system is a reduction in overhead.

The Barcode Generator can be used for any kind of entity, and by default, Spryker provides a solution for products.

**What is a barcode?**
A barcode is a square or rectangular image consisting of a series of parallel black lines (bars) and white spaces of varying widths that can be read by a scanner and printed. Barcodes are applied to entities as a means of quick identification.

In the default configuration, barcodes are generated based on the SKU of a concrete product using the Code128 format. Though, Spryker provides highly customizable solutions through plugins with the help of which the setup can be changed.

Barcodes are dynamically generated for concrete products. This ensures that barcodes are immediately valid.

You can see the barcodes in the **Products > Product Barcode** section. The section is designed as a review; thus no actual actions are performed here. The barcode is generated automatically once a new concrete product is added.

You can see Product ID, product name, SKU, and the barcode itself.
