This topic contains the reference information for working with reclamations in **Sales** > **Reclamations**.
***

After a reclamation has been created, i.e. the order has been flagged as "claimed", it will appear on the **Overview of reclamations** page. 

The following information is available on the page:
* Reclamation number and date of creation
* Customer name and email
* Order state (either opened or closed) and order id
* Actions that you can perform on the reclamation (**View** and **Close**)
