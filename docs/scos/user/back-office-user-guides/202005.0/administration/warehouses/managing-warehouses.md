See [Warehouses: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/administration/warehouses/references/warehouses-reference-information.html) for more details on the attributes you see.
2. On the **View Warehouse: [Warehouse name]** page the following information is available:
    * warehouse name
    * status: whether the warehouse is available or not
    * store(s) in which the warehouse is available


## Editing Warehouse Details
To edit the warehouse details:

1. In the *Actions* column, click **Edit** for the warehouse you want to update. This will take you to the **Edit Warehouse: [Warehouse name]** page. 
2. In the **Configuration** tab, make changes to the needed attributes. See [Warehouses: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/administration/warehouses/references/warehouses-reference-information.html) for more details on the attributes you can update.
3. Switch to the **Store relation** tab and specify the store in which you want the warehouse to be available.
