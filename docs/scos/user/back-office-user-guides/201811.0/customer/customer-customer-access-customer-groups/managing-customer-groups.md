This article describes how you can create and manage customer groups.
***
To start working with customer groups, navigate to the **Customers > Customer Groups** section.
***
Out-of-the-box, there are no connections between customer groups and any other Back Office feature, except for the Discounts. You can set up the discount conditions to be applied to a specific customer group. See [Discount Conditions: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/merchandising/discount/references/discount-conditions-reference-information.html) for more information on what the discount conditions are.
***
## Adding a Customer Group
To add a customer group:

1. On the **Customer groups** page, click **Add Customer Group** in the top right corner.
    On the **Add a Customer Group** page there are two tabs: **General Information** and **Customers**.
2. In the **General Information** tab, enter the name and description for your customer group.
3. Click **Next** to proceed to the **Customers** tab, or just click on it.
4. In the **Customers** tab, select the checkboxes in the _select_ column for the customers you want to assign to this group.
    You can select as many customers as needed.
5. Once done, click **Save**.
***
## Editing a Customer Group
To edit a customer group:
1. On the **Customer groups** page, click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column for the specific group you want to edit.
2. Update the needed attributes.
    To unassign a user from the group, scroll down to the **Assigned customers** table and clear the checkbox on the left of the user you want to unassign. **OR** if you want to reassign all customers, click **De-select All**.
3.  Click **Save**
***
## Viewing Customer Groups
To view a customer group, click **View** in the _Actions_ column for a specific customer group you want to view.

On this page, you can:
* Click **Edit Customer Group** in the top right corner and initiate the editing flow.
* Click **View** in the _Actions_ column for a specific customer assigned to this group. This will take you to the **View Customer** page (the **Customers > Customers** section).
