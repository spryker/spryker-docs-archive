This article describes the procedures for creating and managing customers.
***
To start managing customers, navigate to the **Customers > Customers** section.
***
## Creating a Customer

**To create a new customer:**
1. Click **Add Customer** in the top-right corner of the **Customers** page.
2. On the **Add a customer** page, enter the customer information. The customer information must include first name, last name, and the email address that will be linked to the new account. The email address is important for completing the registration (by accessing the link that will be sent by email) or for later use of the forgot password functionality.
3. Send password token by email by selecting the **Send password token through email** checkbox. After saving the customer data, an email will be sent to the customer containing a link. By accessing the link, the customer will be able to set a password for the account.
  {% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

  If you donâ€™t select this option, the customer is still able to set a password for their account, by clicking the reset password link from the online store.

  {% endinfo_block %}

4. To complete the customer creation, click **Save**.

To know more about the attributes you see, select, and enter while creating a customer, see the [Customers: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/customer/customers-customer-access-customer-groups/references/customers-reference-information.html) article.

## Editing Customers

**To edit a customer:**
1. For a specific customer, you need to update, click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column on the **Customers** page.
2. On the **Edit Customer** page you see the same attributes as on the **Add a customer** page, but with the following exceptions:
   *  The **Email** field is greyed out and is not available for updates.
   * You see two additional drop-down lists: **Billing Address** and **Shipping Address**. The values in those fields appear only if the addresses were added in the customer profile in the online store, or from the **Back Office > View** specific customer page. Those are not available for modifications from the **Edit Customer** page.
3. Update the needed values and click **Save**.
***

**Tips and tricks**

From the **Edit customer** page you can:
* Switch to the **View** customer page, where you can manage the addresses by adding a new address or updating the existing one (see the _Viewing Customer Details_ section below)
* Delete the customer record (see the _Deleting a Customer Record_ section below)
***
