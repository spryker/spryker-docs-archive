This topic describes the procedures for creating and managing company users. This is the final step in the company account setup.
***

The company user can be created only if the company role, company, and business unit exist.
***

To start managing company users, navigate to the **Company Account > Company Users** section.
*** 

## Creating a Company Users

To add a new company user:

1. On the **Overview of Company Users** page, click **Add User** in the top right corner.
2. On the **Create Company User** page:
   1. Enter customer's email, salutation, first name, last name, and gender in the respective fields.
   2. If you want the email with change password details be sent to the customer, select the **Send password token through email** checkbox.
   3. Enter the date of birth and phone values.
   4. Select company and business units from the respective drop-down lists.
   5. Check the checkbox for Roles you want to assign to the user. The values available for selection are limited by those assigned to a company.

3. Once done, click **Save**.

2. On the **Attach to Business Unit** page:
   1. Select a business unit you would like the company user to be attached to from the drop-down list.
   2. Assign the role under the **Assigned Roles** section.
3. Click **Save**.
***

## Editing a Company User

To edit a company user:
1. On the **Overview of Company Users** page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit** for the user you want to update.
2. Update the needed values and click **Save**.

## Enabling/Disabling a Company User

If the company User is currently deactivated, there will be the **Enable** option in the _Actions_ column. Click it to activate the user.

And vice versa, if the user is enabled, they can be disabled here. Click **Disable** to deactivate the user.
