This article describes how you can manage versions of CMS pages: view general information, SEO details, compare CMS versions, and roll back to the selected version or discard changes to a page.
***
To start working with the CMS page versions, navigate to the **Content Management** > **Pages** section.
***
## Viewing CMS Pages History
To view version history for a CMS page:

1. On the **Overview of CMS pages** page in the _Actions_ column, click **View** and select **Version History** from the drop-down list next to the page whose version history you want to view.
2. On the **Version History: [Page Name]** page, the following information is available:
    * Information on the current version and when it was published
    * Name of the page and the template it is using
    * SEO information: title, keywords, and description
    * Placeholders that displays a page title and contain content
    * Option to roll back all the changes to the specific CMS version
    * Option to compare the current version with the selected one

On the **Version History: [Page Name]** page, you can return to the list of CMS pages by clicking **Back to CMS** on the top of the page.
***
### Rolling back to a CMS Page Version
To roll back to the specific version:
1. On the **Version History: [Page Name]** page from the drop-down list, select the version that you want to return to.

2. Click **Rollback to Selected Version** in the top right corner of the page. This will copy all data from the older version and publish the previous version in the online store.

***
### Comparing CMS Versions
To compare CMS versions to see what changes you have made to the current version:
1. On the **Version History: [Page Name]** page from the drop-down list, select the version you want to compare with the current one.
2. Click **Compare**. The information of the selected version will be displayed next to the information about the current version.
