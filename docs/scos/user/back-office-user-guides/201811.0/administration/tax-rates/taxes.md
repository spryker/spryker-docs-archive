The **Taxes** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Spryker Admins.

This section is designed to build tac policies based on country-specific regulations.

Each specific product, as well as the shipment method, or threshold falls under specific taxations. Thus it is crucial for an e-commerce manager to work with the legacy department to define the tax rates and set up those appropriately.

This is how a Spryker Admin interacts with other departments to make sure that the tax-based regulations are met.

## Tax Rates and Sets

In a tax system, a **tax rate** is the ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) at which a business or person is taxed.

A **Tax set** is a set of tax rates that can be applied to a specific product.

In the Back Office, a Spryker Admin creates the tax rates first and then, sets up the tax sets by assigning tax rates to those.

The tax sets are later applied to Products, Thresholds, or Shipment Methods.
