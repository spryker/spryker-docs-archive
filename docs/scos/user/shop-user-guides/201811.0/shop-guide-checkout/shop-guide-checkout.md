Checkout allows purchasing the items added to the cart.

{% info_block infoBox %}
If you have several shopping carts in your account, choose the right one and proceed with the checkout. See [Shop Guide - Shopping Carts](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}multiple-carts-feature-overview.html#multiple-carts-per-user-on-the-storefront
{% endinfo_block %} for more information.)

A typical checkout process includes the following steps:

* [Address](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-checkout/shop-guide-address-step.html): Define one or several delivery addresses and add a billing address.
* [Shipment](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-checkout/shop-guide-shipment-step.html): Select a shipment method and/or a delivery date.
* [Payment](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-checkout/shop-guide-payment-step.html): Select the payment method.
* [Summary](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-checkout/shop-guide-summary-step.html): View the details, update the information, if needed, and place the order.
