## Selecting Another Company User to Log in on Behalf

To log in to a different business unit, do the following:

1. On the *Your Business Unit* page select the required company account from the drop-down:

![Select another company user](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Shop+User+Guides/Business+on+Behalf/select-another-company-user.png)

2. (Optionally) Check **Remember Choice** option if you would like to make this account your default one on login.
3. Click **Submit** to save the changes.

After a successful change, you will be able to see  [COMPANY NAME / BUSINESS UNIT NAME] instead of Your Business Unit menu item:
