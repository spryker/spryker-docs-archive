You can copy the entire cart and its contents if you want to create one more instance of it or a similar cart. To duplicate a shopping cart:

1. Navigate to the **Shopping Carts** page.
2. Click **Duplicate** in the **Shopping Carts List > Action** column if you want to copy the cart and its contents.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

{% endinfo_block %}

## Converting a Shopping Cart into a Shopping List

If you plan to purchase items in your cart repeatedly, it makes sense to convert the cart into a shopping list. This would help you to quickly find and order the products you need frequently. To convert a shopping cart into a shopping list:

1. Navigate to the **Shopping Carts** page.
2. Click **Add to List** in the **Shopping Carts List > Action** column.
3. From the drop-down list, select the existing shopping list where the cart items will be added:

or enter a name and create a new shopping list:

4. Click **Submit**.
***
## Sharing a Shopping Cart

You can share a shopping cart with the company users within your business unit, so that they can view or even fully edit it. To share a shopping cart:

1. Navigate to the **Shopping Carts** page.
2. Click **Share** in the **Shopping Carts List > Action** column.
3. On the **Share my cart** page from the drop-down list next to the users you would like to share the cart with, select the sharing access rights: **No access, Read-only, Full Access**. See [Shared Cart Feature Overview](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/shared-carts-feature-overview.html) for more details on the access rights.

4. Click **Save**.

## Dismissing a Shared Shopping Cart

If you don't need a cart that has been shared with you, you can remove it from your shopping carts list and thus cancel sharing. To do so:

1. Navigate to the **Shopping Carts** page.
2. Click **Dismiss** in the **Shopping Carts List > Action** column.

{% info_block warningBox %}
You can dismiss only the shopping cart shared with you.
{% endinfo_block %}
***
## Deleting a Shopping Cart

To delete a shopping cart:

1. Navigate to the Shopping Carts page.
2. Click **Delete** in the **Shopping Carts List > Action** column if you want to delete the shopping cart.
3. Click **Delete**.

{% info_block warningBox %}
Deleting a shared shopping cart also deletes it for users it has been shared with.
{% endinfo_block %}

3. Click **Copy** to copy the link and provide to an external user.

### Sharing a Cart via Link with the Internal Users

1. Navigate to the **Shopping Cart** page.
2. In the **Share Cart via Link** widget, select **Internal Users**.
3. Depending on the level of access you would like to share the cart with, click **Copy** to copy the link.
