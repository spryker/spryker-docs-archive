This topic describes the procedure for managing the RFQs from the perspective of the Sales Representative.

{% info_block infoBox %}

To be able to perform the tasks, you need to be logged into an Agent Account. Try using our [test agent account](http://www.b2b.demo-spryker.com/agent/login), the username is `admin@spryker.com`, password is `change123`.

{% endinfo_block %}

A Sales Representative can manage the RFQs with the In Progress status by:

* Viewing the RFQs for the company.
* Creating RFQs for buyers.
* Editing the items in the RFQ.
* Suggesting prices by editing them directly in the RFQs.
* Editing prices per shipment cost.
* Editing a delivery address and a shipment method.

***
## Viewing the RFQs

To view the RFQs created both by yourself as a Sales Representative or by Buyers, hover over the **Quote Request Widget** in the header. In the **Quote Request Widget**, the latest 5 RFQs are shown by default. To view all the RFQs, click **View all requests**.

## Creating an RFQ for a Buyer

A Sales Representative can create an RFQ for a customer if for some reason the customer can not do it. Also, a Sales Representative can create a price suggestion for a customer on their own initiative, without the customer's request.

To create an RFQ for a Buyer:

1. In the header, hover over the **Quote Requests Widget** and click **Create new Quote Request**.
2. On the **Create Quote Request** page in the **Select customer**: field, start entering the Buyer's name for whom the Quote Request is being created.
3. From the drop-down list of suggestions, select the necessary Buyer and click **Save**.
4. To keep the changes, click **Save**. The quote request will be updated and the **Edit Quote Request** page opens.
5. To add items to the RFQ, click **Edit Items**, and then use one of the following options:
    * In the **Quick add to Cart** widget, enter a SKU or a name of the concrete product and its quantity, and click **Add to Cart**.
    * From the catalog, select the product, choose the options and quantity, and click **Add to Cart**.
    * On the **Quick Order** page, enter a SKU or a name of the concrete product and its quantity, and click **Add to Cart**. For more information on Quick Order, see [Shop Guide - Quick Order](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-quick-order.html).
    * On the **Shopping list** page, click the shopping list, select the checkboxes for the items you want to add from the shopping list, and click **Add to Cart**. For more information on Quick Order, see [Shop Guide - Shopping Lists](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-customer-account/shop-guide-shopping-lists.html).
6. In the **Quote Request** widget on top of the page, do the following:
    * click **Save** to keep the changes.
    * click **Save and Back to Edit** to keep the changes and return to the **Edit Quote Request** page.
    * click **Cancel** to discard the changes youâ€™ve added.

## Revising the RFQs and Sending to Buyers

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

RFQ version number changes upon each revision. Check [RFQ Versioning](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/quotation-process-feature-overview.html#rfq-workflows) to learn about the version change process.

{% endinfo_block %}
To respond to Buyers' Quote Requests and suggest them special prices, you need to revise the Quote Requests and send them to customers. You can revise the Quote Requests only in the *Draft*, *Waiting*, *In Progress*, and *Ready* statuses.

To revise a Quote Request:

1. On the **Quote Request** page, click **Revise** for the Quote with the *Draft* or *Waiting* status. See *Changing the Price for Products* for the detailed information on how to edit prices while revising a Quote Request.

{% info_block infoBox %}

Once you clicked Revise, the quote's status changes to* In Progress*. The Buyer also sees the quote status change on the **Customer Account -> Quote Request** page.

{% endinfo_block %}

If the Quote Request's status is *In Progress*, click **Edit**.
Now you can:
a. *(Optional)* Update the RFQ details by:
 * Entering a **Purchase order number**.
 * Adding the **Notes**.
* Selecting a due date in the **Do not ship later than** field.
* Selecting the **Show the latest version to customer** checkbox to allow the Buyer to see the updates you have done in the RFQ.
* Adding a date until which the RFQ expires in the **Valid Till** field.
![Create RFQ agent](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Shop+User+Guides/RFQ/Shop+Guide+-+Managing+Requests+for+Quotes+for+a+Sales+Representative/create-rfq-agent.png)

b. *(Optional)* Change the prices for products in the RFQ and offer your customers a special price. To do that, clear **Use Default Prices** checkbox next to the product for which you want to update the price.
![Change a price for RFQ agent](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Shop+User+Guides/RFQ/Shop+Guide+-+Managing+Requests+for+Quotes+for+a+Sales+Representative/change-price-rfq-agent.png)

2. After the Quote Request has been revised, you can either **Save** it or **Send to Customer**.
![image](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Shop+User+Guides/RFQ/Shop+Guide+-+Managing+Requests+for+Quotes+for+a+Sales+Representative/rfq-revise-agent.png)
Clicking **Save** means that the RFQ has been saved, however, the Buyer will not see these changes. The **Save** option is useful when you have not finished revising the RFQ yet and want to get back to it later.

Once you have finished revising the RFQ, you need to send it to the Buyer, so they can see your suggestion.

{% info_block infoBox %}

Clicking **Send to Customer** changes the quote's status to Ready. The customer can either convert the ready Quote Request to cart or request an even better price.

{% endinfo_block %}
