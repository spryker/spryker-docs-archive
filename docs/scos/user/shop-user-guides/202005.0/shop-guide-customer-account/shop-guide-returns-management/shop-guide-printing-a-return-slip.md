After you have [created a return](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-customer-account/shop-guide-returns-management/shop-guide-creating-a-return.html) for order or a Shop Owner has done it for you, you can [print the return slip](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/return-management-feature-overview/return-management-feature-overview.html).

To print the return slip:

1. Go to *My Account > Returns* page.
2. In the Actions column next to the return you want to print the return slip for, click **Print Slip**. This takes you to the print version of the return slip.
