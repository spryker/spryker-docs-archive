If you are not satisfied with the order items received from the seller or don’t need the items anymore, and the items are [returnable](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/return-management-feature-overview/return-management-feature-overview.html) according to the Return Policy, you can return them.

To return items from your order:

1. Go to *My Account > Order History*.
2. Click the return arrow next to the order you want to return. This takes you to the *Create Return* page.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

You can also access the *Create Return* page from the *Order Details* page. To access the *Order Details* page, go to  *My Account > Order History* and click **View Order**. Clicking **Create Return** in the top right corner of the *Order Details* page takes you to the *Create Return* page.

{% endinfo_block %}

3. Select the item(s) you want to return and, optionally, a reason for the return.
{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

For a [Configurable Bundle](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/configurable-bundle-feature-overview.html), you can’t select to return an entire Configurable Bundle, but you can select to return separate items from it.
The [Product Bundles](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-information-management/product-bundles.html), on the contrary, are handled as one product, so only the whole bundle can be returned. You can not return individual items of a Product Bundle.

{% endinfo_block %}

4. Click **Create Return**. This takes you to the *Return Details* page which contains all the information on your return.
