The article describes how you can manage the existing company roles.
***
## Editing an Existing Company Role

You can edit the existing role settings by completing the steps below:

1. On the **Company Roles** page, click **Edit** next to the company user you would like to edit.
2. Update the necessary settings.
A role includes a set of permissions that can be enabled/disabled according to your needs by switching the toggle in **Enable** column. See [Company Roles: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-company-roles/references/company-roles-reference-information.html) to learn the permissions you can assign/unassign.
3. Click **Submit**.

## Deleting a Company Role

You can delete a company user by clicking **Delete** icon next to the company user you are going to delete. Confirm the removal by clicking **Delete**.
