If a shop owner offers some additional items (product options), you can add them to the cart together with the product you are going to purchase, for example, warranty, insurance or gift wrapping, or leave your feedback regarding the product in the **Ratings & Reviews** section. 

Under **Ratings & Reviews**, a set of **similar products** can be displayed. In this set, shop owners usually recommend products that are similar in properties to the product you are viewing and might match the requirements you are looking for in the product. If you want to view or add the product to the cart, click the product card. This will redirect you to the product detail page of this specific product where you can view product information and/or add it to the cart.
