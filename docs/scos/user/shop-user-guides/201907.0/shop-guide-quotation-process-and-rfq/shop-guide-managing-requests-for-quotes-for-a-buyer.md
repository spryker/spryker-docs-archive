This topic describes the procedure for managing the Request for Quotes (RFQs) from the Buyer perspective:

* How to send an RFQ to a Sales Representative, accept the new prices or negotiate a better price than suggested.
* How to edit the RFQs and their items.
* How to cancel the RFQs.

You can do this all from the Quote Request page. You will be taken to this page when you:

* Initially create an RFQ from the Cart page. See [Creating an RFQ (Buyer)](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/quotation-proces-and-rfq/shop-guide-creating-a-request-for-quote.html) for more information.
* Open a Quote Request which is in the *Draft* status in the **Customer Account â†’ Quote Request**.

See [Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/quotation-proces-and-rfq/shop-guide-request-for-quote-reference-information.html) for details on components the Quote Request page consists of.

## Sending an RFQ to a Sales Representative

You can send the newly-created RFQs and the ones that are in *Draft* status to a Sales Representative for a review. To send an RFQ to a Sales Representative:

1. Open the **Quote Request** page.
2. Click **Send to Agent**.

Your Quote Request will be sent to the Sales Representative. You can check the RFQ's status in the **Customer Account -> Quote Request**.

See [Buyer Workflow](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/quotation-proces-and-rfq/shop-guide-request-for-quote-reference-information.html) for more information on request statuses and workflow.
***
## Processing a Ready RFQ

Once a Sales Representative has prepared a price suggestion and sent it to you, your RFQ will acquire the Ready status on **Quote Request** page. You can either accept the suggestion by converting the request to cart, or you can request an even better price.

To convert an RFQ to cart, on the **Quote Request** page for the RFQ that is in the status Ready, click **Convert to Cart**.

From now on, you can continue to [Checkout](/docs/scos/user/shop-user-guides/{{page.version}}/shop-guide-checkout/shop-guide-checkout.html).

To request an even better price, you need to revise the RFQ.
