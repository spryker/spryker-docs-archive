## Creating a New Company

To create a Company in the web-shop, go to `/company/register` and register a company.

![Register a company](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Shop+User+Guides/Company+Account/register-company.png) 

Fill in the required (*) fields to complete the registration.

After the company has been registered, it should be approved in the [Back Office](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/customer/company-account/managing-companies.html#approving-and-activating-a-company) to continue building the hierarchy.

Once the company is approved, a Company Administrator can go to `/company/overview` page and create (and then also edit and delete) users, addresses, roles and business roles.

A Company Administrator needs to log out and then log in to refresh the changes.
