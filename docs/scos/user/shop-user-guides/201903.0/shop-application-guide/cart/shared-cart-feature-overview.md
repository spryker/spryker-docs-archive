Shopping Cart is a part of the online shop where the record of the items a buyer has 'picked up' from the online store is kept. The shopping cart enables consumers to select products, review what they selected, make modifications or add extra items if needed, and purchase the products.

There are two ways to access a shopping cart: through a shopping cart widget in the header of the webshop, or from *Shopping Cart* page in *My Account* menu. New items are added to the shopping cart by clicking on *Add to Cart* button on the product details page.

To share a shopping cart, a user needs to click on *Share cart* button beside a cart they would like to share on the *Shopping Cart* page in *My Account* menu.

## Permission Management for Shared Shopping Carts

A shopping cart can be shared with the users of the current business unit. The *Share cart* [SHOPPING CART NAME] page consists of the users within the business unit to share the shopping cart with.

There are 3 types of access rights that can be granted on shopping carts: no access, read-only and full access.

**No access** means that shopping cart is not shared and therefore can not be seen by a user.

No access permission is applied automatically to a newly-created cart.

**Read-only** permission allows:

**Reading shopping cart.** On the *Shopping cart* page, the user sees shopping cart name, access level (*Read only*), as well as the table of items with the following information:

* Product image
* Product name
* SKU
* Product attribute
* Product options
* Quantity
* Note
* Price mode
* Item price
* Cart Note
* Discount
* Subtotal
* Tax
* Grand Total

With Read-only permission, no cart actions are available to the user.

By default, the user who has created the cart has Owner access permission. Owner access permission allows everything that allows Full access permission and an ability to share the cart with other users.
If user does not need a cart, that has been shared with them, it is possible to remove it from their shopping carts and thus cancel the sharing. To do so, the user clicks Dismiss on Shopping Cart page in Actions next to the respective shared shopping cart. It is possible to dismiss sharing shopping carts with both Read only and Full access rights. Own shopping carts cannot be dismissed.
If the shared cart has been dismissed individually by the user, and after that within the business unit, this user will not be able to see it  in case this cart is shared next time.
