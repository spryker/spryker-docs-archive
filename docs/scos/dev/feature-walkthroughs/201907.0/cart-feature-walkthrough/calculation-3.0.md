Spryker uses the Calculation module to calculate the cart totals that are displayed in the cart/checkout or when the order is placed.

The calculation module extensively uses plugins to inject calculation algorithms.

## How Calculation Works

{% info_block infoBox "Quote Transfer" %}

The quote transfer object is used to store data and plugins that calculate the amounts.

{% endinfo_block %}

There is already a list of plugins which populate quote transfer with corresponding data. Calculations are executed every time the content of the cart is updated.

{% info_block infoBox %}

For more details, check [Cart Data Flow](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/cart-feature-overview/cart-functionality-and-calculations/cart-functionality.html#cart-data-flow) in the *Cart Functionality* section.

{% endinfo_block %}

If manual recalculation of cart is required, then `CalculationFacade::recalculate` can be called from Zed or `CalculationClient::recalculate` from Yves with prepared [Calculation Data Structure](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/cart-feature-overview/calculation/calculation-data-structure.html#quote-transfer). When the recalculation operation is called, the calculator runs the calculator plugin stack and each plugin modifies the `QuoteTransfer` (calculates discounts, adds sum gross prices, calculates taxes, etc. Most plugins require the `unitGrossPrice` and the `quantity` to be provided.

{% info_block infoBox "Calculated amounts" %}

Each amount is being calculated and stored in cents.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Calculator Plugins

Calculator plugins are registered in the `CalculationDependencyProvider::getCalculatorStack()` method. This method can be extended on the project level and the plugin stack can be updated with your own plugins. Each calculator must implement `CalculatorPluginInterface`.

For more information see:

```php
<?php
interface CalculatorPluginInterface
{
    /**
     * @param QuoteTransfer $quoteTransfer
     *
    public function recalculate(QuoteTransfer $quoteTransfer);
}
```

* **RemoveTotalsCalculatorPlugin** - Resets quote totals, sets `TotalsTransfer` empty.
* **RemoveAllCalculatedDiscountsCalculatorPlugin** - Resets every `CalculatedDiscountTransfer`.
* **ItemGrossAmountsCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates `sumGrossPrice` for each `ItemTransfer`.

`ItemTransfer::sumGrossPrice = ItemTransfer::unitGrossPrice * ItemTransfer::quantity`

* **ProductOptionGrossSumCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates `unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions`, `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions` for `ItemTransfer` and `sumGrossPrice` for `ProductOptionTransfer`. - Calculates `unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions`, `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions` for `ItemTransfer` and `sumGrossPrice` for `ProductOptionTransfer`.

```php
ProductOptionTransfer::sumGrossPrice = ProductOptionTransfer::unitGrossPrice * ProductOptionTransfer::quantity
ItemTransfer::unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions = sum(ProductOptionTransfer::unitGrossPrice) + ItemTransfer::unitGrossPrice
ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions = sum(ProductOptionTransfer::sumGrossPrice) + ItemTransfer:sumGrossPrice
```

* **SubtotalTotalsCalculatorPlugin** - Sums each of the `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions` items.

`TotalsTransfer::subtotal = sum(ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions)`

* **ExpensesGrossSumAmountCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates `sumGrossPrice` for each item.

`ExpenseTransfer::sumGrossPrice = ExpenseTransfer::unitGrossPrice * ExpenseTransfer::quantity`

* **ExpenseTotalsCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates `expenseTotal` in `TotalsTransfer`.

`TotalsTransfer::expenseTotal = sum(ExpenseTransfer::sumGrossPrice)`

* **DiscountCalculatorPlugin** - Applies discounts to current `QuoteTransfer` each discountable item with property `calculatedDiscounts`, gets discounts filled. Also, `voucherDiscounts` and `cartRuleDiscounts` are populated with additional used discount data for order level.

{% info_block infoBox "Discount Calculation" %}
Discount calculation is a separate topic and is explained in the [Discount](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/promotions-and-discounts/discount/discount-feature-overview.html#calculation
{% endinfo_block %} article.)


* **SumGrossCalculatedDiscountAmountCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates and sets `ItemTransfer` amounts after discounts to `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts` and `unitGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts`; sets expense amounts after discounts to `unitGrossPriceWithDiscounts` and `sumGrossPriceWithDiscounts`.

```php
ItemTransfer::unitGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts = ItemTransfer::unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions -  (sum(ItemTransfer:calculatedDiscounts::unitGrossPrice) + sum(ProductOptionTransfer::calculatedDiscounts::unitGrossPrice))
ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts = ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions -  (sum(ItemTransfer:calculatedDiscounts::sumGrossPrice) + sum(ProductOptionTransfer::calculatedDiscounts::sumGrossPrice))
```

* **DiscountTotalsCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates total for discounts used and sets it to `totalDiscount` in `TotalsTransfer`. Sum all discountable item `CalculatedDiscountTransfer` gross amounts:

```php
TotalsTransfer:discountTotal += sum(ItemTransfer::CalculateDiscountTransfer::sumGrossAmount +
ItemTransfer::ProductOptionTransfer::CalculateDiscountTransfer::sumGrossAmount + ExpenseTransfer::sumGrossAmount)
GrandTotalTotalsCalculatorPlugin - Calculates grandTotal in TotalsTransfer.
TotalsTransfer:grandTotal = TotalsTransfer::subtotal + TotalsTransfer:expenseTotal
```

* **GrandTotalWithDiscountsCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates GrandTotal after discounts in `TotalsTransfer`.

`TotalsTransfer:grandTotal = TotalsTransfer::subtotal + TotalsTransfer:expenseTotal - TotalsTransfer::discountTotal`

* **TaxTotalsCalculatorPlugin** - Calculates taxTotal and taxRate used from `TotalTransfer::grandTotal`, sets it in `TotalsTransfer::TaxTotalsTransfer`.


`TaxableItems = ItemTransfer, ProductOptionTransfer, ExpenseTransfer. TaxTotalsTransfer::taxRate = sum(TaxableItems) / TaxableItems TaxTotalsTransfer::taxAmount = round((TotalsTransfer::grandTotal * TaxTotalsTransfer::taxRate) / TaxTotalsTransfer::taxRate / 100)`
