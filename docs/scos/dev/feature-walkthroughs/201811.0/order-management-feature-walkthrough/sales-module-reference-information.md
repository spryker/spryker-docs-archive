The Sales module provides the order management functionality. The functionality is obtained through the ZED UI that renders orders with orders details and the Client API to get customer orders.

## Getting Totals for Order
To get the Order with totals, the facade method SalesFacade::getOrderByIdSalesOrder() creates an order level which returns the OrderTransfer with a hydrated grandTotal, subtotal, expense, discounts and more

{% info_block warningBox %}
This is an improvement from the Sales 5.0 version where you had to use `SalesAggregatorFacade` to get totalks. This version has been deprecated.
{% endinfo_block %}

## Persisting Order Calculated Values
All calculated values are persisted now, when order are first placed. The values are stored by orderSaver plugins from checkout bundle. Check `\Pyz\Zed\Checkout\CheckoutDependencyProvider::getCheckoutOrderSavers` for currently available plugins.

Some values can change during time when order refunded or partially refunded. Then `canceled_amount` and `refundable_amount` are recalculated and new values is persisted. At the same moment totals also change, but it does not overwrite old entry, but creates new row in `spy_sales_order_total` with this you have a history of order totals from the time order was placed.

The following ER diagram shows persisted calculated values:

## Extension Points
HydrateOrderPluginInterface - its an action which happens when `SalesFacade::getOrderByIdSalesOrder()` method is called. This means that you may want to enrich you `OrderTransfer` with additional data. This plugins accepts passes `OrderTransfer` for additional population.

There are already few plugins provided:

* `DiscountOrderHydratePlugin` - hydrates `OrderTransfer` with discount related data as it was stored when order is placed.
* `ProductOptionOrderHydratePlugin` - hydrates `OrderTransfer` with product option related data.
* `ProductBundleOrderHydratePlugin` - hydrates `OrderTransfer` with product bundle related data.
* `ShipmentOrderHydratePlugin` - hydrates `OrderTransfer` with shipment related data.
