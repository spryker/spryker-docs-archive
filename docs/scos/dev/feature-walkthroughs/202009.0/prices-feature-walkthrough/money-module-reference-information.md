{% info_block infoBox "Money" %}
Handling monetary values can be a problem and is often quite hard. The Money bundle makes it easier to work with monetary values.

Spryker handles all monetary values as integer and provides conversions from decimal values to cent values and vice versa.

The key feature of this module is to convert a `MoneyTransfer` into the proper string version of it, given the current locale and currency.


## Usage
The Money module is very straight forward and easy to use. The MoneyFacade exposes the following methods:

- `MoneyFacade::fromInteger()`
- `MoneyFacade::fromFloat()`
- `MoneyFacade::fromString()`
- `MoneyFacade::formatWithCurrency()`
- `MoneyFacade::formatWithoutCurrency()`
- `MoneyFacade::convertIntegerToDecimal()`
- `MoneyFacade::convertDecimalToInteger()`

### MoneyFacade::from*() methods

Internally we use a powerful implementation of the Money Pattern. Outside the Money module you will only see the MoneyTransfer which encapsulates our internals.

To get a money object you can call the `MoneyFacade::from*()` methods:

| Module | Called with |
| --- | --- |
| MoneyFacade::fromInteger(1000) | integer |
| MoneyFacade::fromInteger(1000, 'EUR') | integer and currency |
| MoneyFacade::fromFloat(10.00) | float |
| MoneyFacade::fromFloat(10.00, 'EUR') | float and currency |
| MoneyFacade::fromString('1000') | string |
| MoneyFacade::fromString('1000', 'EUR') | string and currency |

All of them will return a `MoneyTransfer` with a `MoneyTransfer::$amount` of `‘1000’`.

{% info_block infoBox %}
The only difference between them is the `MoneyTransfer::$currency`. This value differs if you pass a currency to the `MoneyFacade::from*(
{% endinfo_block %}` methods or not.)

* In case you don’t pass a currency, the currency configured as default one will be used.
* If you pass a specific currency, it will be used instead of the one that’s configured as default one.

**`MoneyFacade::formatWithSymbol()`**
`MoneyFacade::formatWithSymbol()` method accepts only one argument - a MoneyTransfer. It will return a string representation of the given object, considering the current locale.

{% info_block infoBox "Example:" %}
MoneyTransfer::$amount = 1000<br>MoneyTransfer::$currency = ‘EUR’<br>Current locale is de_DE<br>The output would be 10,00 €<br>If the current locale would be en_US, the output would be: €10.00 when passing the same object.
{% endinfo_block %}

**`MoneyFacade::formatWithoutSymbol()`**
`MoneyFacade::formatWithoutSymbol()` method has the same behavior as the `MoneyFacade::formatWithSymbol()`, except of the fact that the currency symbol is not included.

{% info_block infoBox %}
The output would then be `10,00` or `10.00` for the above example.
{% endinfo_block %}

**`MoneyFacade::convertIntegerToDecimal()`**
In some cases you will need a plain decimal representation of the value in integer (e.g. cents). This can be useful e.g. for API calls.

**`MoneyFacade::convertDecimalToInteger()`**
In some cases you will need an integer (e.g. cents) representation for a decimal value. This can be useful when you want to store monetary values in the database.

## Money Collection Form Type
From Money version 2.2.*, you can have money collection form type inside your forms which will allow to include complex form collection that will render table with currency per store and gross/net price.

For example, add FormBuilder in your form Type:

```php
/**
 * @param \Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface $builder
 *
 * @return $this
 */
protected function addMoneyValueCollectionType(FormBuilderInterface $builder)
	{
    	$builder->add(
        	DiscountCalculatorTransfer::MONEY_VALUE_COLLECTION, //is the property in the main form you want to map. It should be transferred as in example
         	MoneyCollectionType::class,
            	[
                	MoneyCollectionType::OPTION_AMOUNT_PER_STORE => false, //If you want to render per store, set it to true
              	]
        );

        return $this;
	}
```

Also, you need to modify twig template to include form money value collection table.

```
{% raw %}{{{% endraw %} form_money_collection(mainForm.moneyValueCollection) {% raw %}}}{% endraw %}
```

This will render table with all currencies enabled in store. You have to handle persistence yourself, which means that you have to save and read data to `MoneyValueTransfer` collection.

{% info_block infoBox %}
Component provides only initial data.
