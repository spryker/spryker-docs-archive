The [Elastica](https://github.com/spryker/elastica) module is a wrapper around 3rd-party library for interacting with Elasticsearch. It does not contain any code and usually should not be updated alone. Its version is managed either by the [Search](https://github.com/spryker/search) module or by the [SearchElasticsearch](https://github.com/spryker/search-elasticsearch) module.
