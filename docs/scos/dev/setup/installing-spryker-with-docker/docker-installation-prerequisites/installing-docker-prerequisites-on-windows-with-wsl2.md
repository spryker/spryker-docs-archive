This document describes the prerequisites for installing Spryker in Docker on Windows.


## System requirements for installing Spryker with Docker

Review the system and software requirements in the table.

| REQUIREMENT | VALUE OR VERSION | ADDITIONAL DETAILS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | 10 64bit | Pro, Enterprise, or Education (1607 Anniversary Update, Build 14393 or later). |
| BIOS Virtualization | Enabled | Typically, virtualization is enabled by default. Note that having the virtualization enabled is different from having Hyper-V enabled. This setting can be checked in the **Task Manager** â†’ **Performance** tab.  For more details, see [Virtualization must be enabled](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled). |
| CPU SLAT-capable feature | Enabled |SLAT is CPU related feature. It is called Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI). |
| Docker | 18.09.1 or higher |
| Docker Compose | 1.28 or 1.29 |  
| RAM  | 4GB or more |
| Swap  | 2GB or more |

## Installing and configuring the required software with WSL2

{% info_block infoBox "WSL1 and WSL2" %}

If you cannot use WSL2, you can [install and configure the required software with WSL1](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-windows-with-wsl1.html). Since WSL1 is outdated, you may get multiple issues with its configuration. We recommend using WSL2 if possible.

{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block warningBox %}

When running commands described in this document, use absolute paths. For example: `mkdir /d/spryker && cd $_` or `mkdir /c/Users/spryker && cd $_`.

{% endinfo_block %}

Follow the steps below to install and configure the required software with WSL2:

1. [Enable WSL2 and install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).

2. In the **General** tab of the Docker Desktop settings, select **Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS**.

3. To save the settings, select **Apply & Restart**.

4. Install Ubuntu 20.04.

5. Run Ubuntu and update it:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

6. Exit Ubuntu and restart Windows.

You've installed and configured the required software.
