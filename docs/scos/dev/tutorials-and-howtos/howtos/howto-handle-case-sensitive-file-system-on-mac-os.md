By default Mac OS uses a case-insensitive file system to support compatibility to applications (e.g. Photoshop) provided for the operating system. The file-system itself is capable of working in a case-sensitive mode. There are a number of options on how to change case sensitivity:

1. Re-partition the entire hard drive with case-sensitivity turned on.
2. Create a new partition and re-format only this new partition with the case-sensitive file-system.
3. Create a disk image, format that image with the case-sensitive file-system, and mount this disk image.

Options 1 and 2 will require tampering with an existing hard drive that contains your operating system. Option 3 is the least destructive and requires very little effort.

## Creating The Disk Image
We can use Mac OS' Disk Utility application to create a disk image. We will create a growing image with decent size so we don't waste any hard drive space bit still keep enough room for many projects.

1. Open Disk Utility by opening Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and typing disk utilityю
2. Choose File > New Image > Blank Image.
3. Enter a file name for the disk image (e.g. case-sensitive-file-system).
4. Select the place where to store the image (e.g. your home folder).
5. Enter a name for the image (e.g. workspace). This name will we shown in Finder once the image is mounted. I like to have matching names for the mountpoint and disk image name so Finder will display it nicely. For my local setup I use workspace as the image's name and mount-point.
6. Enter a decent value for the size so the image can accommodate all your projects (e.g. 100GB).
7. Select the format: Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled).
8. Encryption and partitions can be left as is.
9. Select the image format: Sparse (be careful: Somethimes changing the image format will reset the setting for image size).

The resulting dialog should look something like this:
![Case sensitive file system](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Tutorials/HowTos/HowTo+-+Handle+Case+Sensitive+File-System/case+sensitive+system.png) 

After the disk has been created you can see it being mounted in Finder already.

## Copying Existing Projects
You can copy all existing projects to the newly created box. If it is not mounted simply double-click the disk image file in Finder. After you copied all your projects I suggest replacing your current project directory with the mount-point (please, see the next section _Automatically Mounting Disk Image at Boot_) for the disk image so you don't have to adjust any paths you already set up.

## Automatically Mounting Disk Image at Boot
You don't want to manually mount the disk image every time you restart your system. We will create a Launch Agent that will take care of this.

1. Create a new file for the definition of the Launch Agent under  (e.g. `~Library/LaunchAgents/local.mount-case-sensitive-file-system.plist`)

```
vim ~Library/LaunchAgents/local.mount-case-sensitive-file-system.plist
```

2. Place the following content inside the file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>local.mount-case-sensitive-file-system</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>hdiutil</string>
            <string>attach</string>
            <string>[ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DISK_IMAGE]</string>
            <string>-mountpoint</string>
            <string>[ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MOUNT_POINT]</string>
            <string>-nobrowse</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</plist>
```
Please put in some values for `[ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DISK_IMAGE]` (e.g. `/Users/joeaverage/case-sensitive-file-system.sparseimage`) and `[ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MOUNT_POINT]` (e.g. `/Users/joeaverage/workspace`). Please make sure that the `mount-point` folder exists and is empty.

## Configuring PHP Storm
The first time you open one of the projects form the disk-image you will notice a warning about case-sensitive file-systems. PHPStorm for Mac OS is configured to work with a case-insensitive file-system and will report a warning that it detected a case-sensitive file-system. Unfortunately there is no way to configure PHPStorm on a per-project level but we can let PHPStorm know that all our projects will be stored on a case-sensitive file system.

1. Open PHPStorm and go to Help> Edit Custom Properties.
2. Add the following option: `idea.case.sensitive.fs=true`.
3. Save and close.
