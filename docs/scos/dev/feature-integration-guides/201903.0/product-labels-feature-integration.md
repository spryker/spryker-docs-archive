## Prerequisites

To prepare your project for using Product Labels:

1. Require the Product Label module in your `composer.json` by running `composer require spryker/product-label spryker/product-label-collector spryker/product-label-gui`
2. Install the required changes to the data structure by running console `propel:diff && console propel:migrate && console propel:model:build`. This will generate a migration file, run the migration against your database, and build all new Propel models.
3. Generate the new transfer objects by running `console transfer:generate`
4. Make sure the new Zed user interface assets are built by running `npm run zed` (or `antelope build zed` for older versions)
5. Update Zed's navigation cache to show the new items for the Product Label management user interface by running console `application:build-navigation-cache`
6. Activate the Product Label collectors by adding `\Spryker\Zed\ProductLabelCollector\Communication\Plugin\ProductLabelDictionaryCollectorStoragePlugin` and `\Spryker\Zed\ProductLabelCollector\Communication\Plugin\ProductLabelProductAbstractRelationCollectorStoragePlugin` to the storage collector plugin stack in your project implementation:

```php
<?php

namespace Pyz\Zed\Collector;

use Spryker\Shared\Navigation\ProductLabelConstants;
use Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Container;
use Spryker\Zed\ProductLabelCollector\Communication\Plugin\ProductLabelDictionaryCollectorStoragePlugin;
use Spryker\Zed\ProductLabelCollector\Communication\Plugin\ProductLabelProductAbstractRelationCollectorStoragePlugin;
// ...

class CollectorDependencyProvider extends SprykerCollectorDependencyProvider
{
 /**
 * @param \Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Container $container
 *
 * @return \Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Container
 */
 public function provideBusinessLayerDependencies(Container $container)
 {
 // ...

 $container[static::STORAGE_PLUGINS] = function (Container $container) {
 return [
 // ...
 ProductLabelConstants::RESOURCE_TYPE_PRODUCT_LABEL_DICTIONARY => new ProductLabelDictionaryCollectorStoragePlugin(),
 ProductLabelConstants::RESOURCE_TYPE_PRODUCT_ABSTRACT_PRODUCT_LABEL_RELATIONS => new ProductLabelProductAbstractRelationCollectorStoragePlugin(),
 ];
 };

 // ...
 }
} 
```

To provide product label information for Search documents, you need to extend your product search collector by adding a new `search-result-data` entry (for example, `id_product_labels`) for products. The data of this field can be easily read with the `ProductLabelFacade::findLabelIdsByIdProductAbstract()` method.

### Data Setup

The Zed user interface can be used to manage product labels. The collectors that were enabled before will take care of exporting active labels to the key-value storage. Product labels can also be imported using the demo-shop's importer infrastructure. Spryker provides a couple of example installer implementations in the [demo-shop](https://github.com/spryker/demoshop) that can be used for ideas.

### Usage in Yves

The Product Label module ships with a Twig extension to easily access and render product labels in templates. The extension provides the `spyProductLabels` twig function that renders labels based on the label dictionary. The function excepts the following parameters:

1. **$idProductLabels**: an array of product label IDs to render labels
2. **$templateName**: The name of a template to use for rendering the labels

It also provides the `spyProductAbstractLabels` Twig function. This function is **deprecated**
 to use due to performance reasons. It first needs to read product label relation information from Storage and only then renders product labels based on the label dictionary. Use this only when it's not possible to have the list of product label IDs for the rendered product. The function excepts the following parameters:

1. **$idProductAbstract**: ID of the abstract product to render labels for
2. **$templateName**: The name of a template to use for rendering the labels

To enable the Twig extension it is necessary to register it as a new service provider in `\Pyz\Yves\Application\YvesBootstrap`
```php

<?php

namespace Pyz\Yves\Application;

use Spryker\Yves\ProductLabel\Plugin\Provider\ProductLabelTwigServiceProvider;
// ...

class YvesBootstrap
{
 /**
 * @return void
 */
 protected function registerServiceProviders()
 {
 // ...
 $this->application->register(new ProductLabelTwigServiceProvider());
 }
} 

```

An example implementation of template rendering labels for an abstract product looks like this (e.g. on a product details page):

```php
<div class="product-labels">
 {% raw %}{{{% endraw %} spyProductLabels(product.getIdProductLabels(), '@ProductLabel/partials/group.twig') {% raw %}}}{% endraw %}
</div> 
```

### Creating a Custom Template for Rendering Product Labels

The template specified in the second parameter in the `spyProductLabels` Twig function receives a collection of transfer objects, each representing a product label containing data from the key-value storage. This collection will be empty for abstract products that are not assigned any product labels. All locale-specific label fields will be returned for the currently active store locale.

Here's a simple example of a possible template:

```php
<div class="product-label-group">
 {% raw %}{%{% endraw %} for productLabelTransfer in productLabelTransferCollection {% raw %}%}{% endraw %}
 <span class="product-label-flag">
 <span class="product-label-flag__content">
 {% raw %}{{{% endraw %} productLabelTransfer.getName() {% raw %}}}{% endraw %}
 </span>
 </span>
 {% raw %}{%{% endraw %} endfor {% raw %}%}{% endraw %}
</div> 
```

A more detailed example implementation is available in the [demo-shop](https://github.com/spryker/demoshop).

### Checking Validity

Product labels can be configured to have a validity date range. They will only be represented in the key-value storage if they fall between the `valid_from` and `valid_to` dates.

To make sure that invalid product labels become valid when the specified validity date range is entered, run the console command `console product-label:validity`. It will also handle labels that are currently valid but become invalid due to exceeding the `valid_to` date. The command checks validity date ranges for all active labels and "touch" the ones for which the validity state changes.

The [demo-shop](https://github.com/spryker/demoshop) ships with a Cronjob triggers this command once a day.

### Dynamic Labels
It's possible to manage product label relations dynamically based on some custom business logic. The custom logic can be implemented with a set of `\Spryker\Zed\ProductLabel\Dependency\Plugin\ProductLabelRelationUpdaterPluginInterface` plugins.

By registering the necessary plugins in `\Pyz\Zed\ProductLabel\ProductLabelDependencyProvider::getProductLabelRelationUpdaterPlugins()`you will be able to run the `vendor/bin/console product-label:relations:update` command from your project to update the dynamic labels of the products.

To enable this console command add `\Spryker\Zed\ProductLabel\Communication\Console\ProductLabelRelationUpdaterConsole`to `\Pyz\Zed\Console\ConsoleDependencyProvider::getConsoleCommands()`. It's also suggested to set a cron job
to run this command periodically. In demoshop we've set this to run every minute so it's aligned with collectors and less likely to experience inconsistency with product data and its labels.

## Under the Hood

### Database Schema
![product_label_db](https://cdn.document360.io/9fafa0d5-d76f-40c5-8b02-ab9515d3e879/Images/Documentation/product_label_db.png) 

The `Product Label` module adds three new tables:

1. **spy_product_label**
This table stores the main product label information such as its name, validity dates, flags, etc.
2. **spy_product_label_localized_attributes**
This tables stores all localized information. Currently it only stores the translated product label names.
3. **spy_product_label_product_abstract**
This table stores the relations between product labels and abstract products.

### Representation in the Key-Value Storage

Product labels are exported in two parts, a dictionary that contains all active and valid product-labels and a list of product label IDs for each abstract product.

#### Product Label Dictionary

The dictionary contains only active and valid product labels. The active state is derived from the `is_active` flag and validity is checked against the `valid_from` and `valid_to` fields. There is a dedicated transfer object that represents the structure of each product label in the dictionary, called `ProductLabelStorageTransfer`.

#### Abstract Product to Product Label Relations

All relations between an abstract product and a product label will be exported not taking into account active state and validity.

When using `\Spryker\Client\ProductLabel\ProductLabelClient::findLabelsByIdProductAbstract()` (or the `spyProductLabels` and `spyProductAbstractLabels` Twig functions) each relation is checked against the dictionary and only a collection of active and valid product labels will be returned for a single abstract product. This prevents having to update each product relation in the key-value storage whenever a product label changes thus reducing the number of required "touches".

## Feature Extensions

### Discounts Based on Product Labels

It's possible to create discount rules based on products that have specific label(s). On the discount UI
select the `product-label` rule for **Discount calculation** to define that the discount will be apply to the selected predefined labels. You can also select the `product-label` rule for **Conditions** to define that your discount is applied when the selected labels are present.

Follow the steps below to activate this feature:

1. Install `ProductLabelDiscountConnector` module in your project.
2. Active the Decision rule and Collector plugins in `\Pyz\Zed\Discount\DiscountDependencyProvider`:

```php
<?php

namespace Pyz\Zed\Discount;

use Spryker\Zed\Discount\DiscountDependencyProvider as SprykerDiscountDependencyProvider;
use Spryker\Zed\ProductLabelDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\Collector\ProductLabelCollectorPlugin;
use Spryker\Zed\ProductLabelDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\DecisionRule\ProductLabelDecisionRulePlugin;

class DiscountDependencyProvider extends SprykerDiscountDependencyProvider
{

    /**
     * @return \Spryker\Zed\Discount\Dependency\Plugin\DecisionRulePluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getDecisionRulePlugins()
    {
        $decisionRulePlugins = parent::getDecisionRulePlugins();
        // ...
        $decisionRulePlugins[] = new ProductLabelDecisionRulePlugin();

        return $decisionRulePlugins;
    }

    /**
     * @return \Spryker\Zed\Discount\Dependency\Plugin\CollectorPluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getCollectorPlugins()
    {
        $collectorPlugins = parent::getCollectorPlugins();
        // ...
        $collectorPlugins[] = new ProductLabelCollectorPlugin();

        return $collectorPlugins;
    }

}
 ```
3. You are ready to use this feature extension.
