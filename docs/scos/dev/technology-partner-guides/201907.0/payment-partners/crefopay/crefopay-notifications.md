Merchant Notification System (MNS) is a push notification service for merchants. The MNS allows merchants to receive a multitude of notifications asynchronously in order to decouple the merchant system from CrefoPayâ€™s payment systems. Also, with the MNS, merchants can react to any kind of change in the payment status of processed transactions.

Notification calls will be targeted at the notification-URL that is configured for the shop. Multiple notification-URLs may be configured for a single shop. This allows merchants to inform more than one system, for example shop system and ERP system.

The Notification-URL can be configured in merchant back end and must have the following format: `http://de.mysprykershop.com/crefo-pay/notification`.
