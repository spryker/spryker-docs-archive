Both credit card and PayPal utilize the same request flow in:

* **Pre-check**: to check the user information to make sure that all the needed information is correct before doing the actual pre-authorization.
* **Authorize**: to perform a payment risk check which is a mandatory step before every payment. The payment is considered accepted when it is authorized.
* **Revert**: to cancel the authorization step which cancels the payment before capturing.
* **Capture**: to capture the payment and receive money from the buyer.
* **Refund**: to refund the buyer when returning products.
