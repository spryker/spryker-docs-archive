To enable the B2B business model for CrefoPay:

```php
$quoteTransfer->setCrefoPayCompany(
    (new CrefoPayApiCompanyTransfer())
        ->setCompanyName('Company Name')
        ->setCompanyRegisterType('UNKNOWN')
        ->setCompanyRegistrationID('registration-id')
        ->setCompanyTaxID('tax-id')
        ->setCompanyVatID('vat-id')
        ->setEmail('business.email@company.com')
);
