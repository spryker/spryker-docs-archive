CrefoPay module can have different capture and refund processes:

* separate transaction for each order item and expense;
* combined transaction for all order items.

For these purposes, the module has different OMS plugins:

* `CapturePlugin`
* `CaptureSplitPlugin`
* `RefundPlugin`
* `RefundSplitPlugin`

You can use the following settings to manage expenses behavior:

* `$config[CrefoPayConstants::CAPTURE_EXPENSES_SEPARATELY]`
* `$config[CrefoPayConstants::REFUND_EXPENSES_WITH_LAST_ITEM]`

With `CapturePlugin` in place, the amount of items in order is captured as one transaction. If you use `$config[CrefoPayConstants::CAPTURE_EXPENSES_SEPARATELY]`, separate transaction will be created for all expenses. `CaptureSplitPlugin` triggers a separate transaction for each order item.

`RefundSplitPlugin` triggers a separate refund call for each order item that you want to refund. `RefundPlugin` implemented for case when you want to refund amount that can be more than item amount.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
You'll get an exception if you trigger Refund process for items with different CaptureIDs (items captured in different transactions).
{% endinfo_block %}
`$config[CrefoPayConstants::REFUND_EXPENSES_WITH_LAST_ITEM]` allows you to refund expenses. It refunds them after the last item has been refunded.
