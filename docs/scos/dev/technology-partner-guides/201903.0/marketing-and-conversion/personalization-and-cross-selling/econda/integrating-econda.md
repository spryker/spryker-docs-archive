## Prerequisites

Our Econda module offers the integration with these services for the application you are building using Spryker.

To integrate with Econda, you will need to connect your Econda account. If you do not have an Econda account please contact [Econda Sales](mailto:sales@econda.com?subject=Sales Request from a Spryker Contact).

To enable Econda tracking for your application, you need to download a personalized JavaScript library from the Econda Analytics Configuration menu (you can find the detailed instructions on the [Econda website](https://support.econda.de/display/MONDE/Tracking-Bibliothek+herunterladen)).

For [cross sell widgets](econda-cross-sell), we will demonstrate integration of JS SDK that you can download from the [Econda website](http://downloads.econda.de/support/releases/js-sdk/current/econda-recommendations.php).

Please refer to [Econda](http://www.econda.de/) documentation on how to customize your Econda widgets.

Some examples can be found at [https://www.econda.de/](https://www.econda.de/)

Details on how to work with Javascript and templates in Spryker can be found in Front-End Guide<!-- link -->.

Econda module uses collectors to [export data to CSV](/docs/scos/user/technology-partners/{{page.version}}/marketing-and-conversion/personalization-and-cross-selling/econda/econda-exporting-csvs.html). Please read more about Collectors.
