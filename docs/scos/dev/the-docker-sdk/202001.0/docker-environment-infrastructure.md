This document describes the infrustructure of Spryker in Docker environment.

Spryker containers  follow the rules:

1. **Single responsibility** - each container is responsible for a single role which must be defined in specification.
2. **Immutability** - container does not create or change files in its own file system. If container requires storage, a volume should be designated for the purpose. Temporary files are not covered by the rule.
3. **A single process or a process group** - there is a single process running as an entry point of container. The name of the process must be defined in specification.
4. **Process run without root permissions.**
5. **Only single-purpose ports are exposed** - the only exposed ports are the ones supporting the single responsibility of container. The port(s) must be defined in specification. Service ports are not covered by the rule.
