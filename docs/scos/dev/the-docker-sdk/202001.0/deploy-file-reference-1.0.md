This reference page describes version 1 of the Deploy file format. This is the newest version.

## Glossary

**Deploy file**

>A YAML file defining Spryker infrastructure and services for Spryker tools used to deploy Spryker applications in different environments.

**Region**

> Defines one or more isolated instances of Spryker applications that have only one persistent database to work with; limits the visibility of a project's **Stores** to operate only with the **Stores** that belong to a **Region**; refers to geographical terms like data centers, regions and continents in the real world.

**Group**

> Defines a group of Spryker applications within a **Region** that is scaled separately from other groups; can be assumed as an auto scaling group in the Cloud.

**Store**

>A store related context a request is processed in.

**Application**

>A Spryker application, like Zed, Yves or Glue.

**Service**

> An external storage or utility service. Represents service type and configuration. The configuration can be defined on different levels: project-wide, region-wide, store-specific or endpoint-specific with limitations based on the service type.

**Endpoint**

> A point of access to **Application** or **Service**. The key format is `domain[:port]`. By default, the port for HTTP endpoints is 80 . Port is mandatory for TCP endpoints.

## Deploy File Structure

The topics below are organized alphabetically for top-level keys and sub-level keys to describe the hierarchy.

You can use the extended YAML syntax according to [YAMLâ„¢ Version 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
Find B2B/B2C deploy file examples for [development](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/installation-guides/choosing-an-installation-mode.html#development-mode) and [demo](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/installation-guides/choosing-an-installation-mode.html#demo-mode) environments in the table:

| Development mode | Demo mode |
| --- | --- |
| [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.dev.yml) | [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml) |
| [B2B Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.dev.yml) | [B2B Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml) |

***
**version**:

Defines the version of the Deploy file format.

This reference page describes the Deploy file format for versions 1.*.

```yaml
version: 1.0

namespace: spryker-demo
...
```
{% info_block infoBox "Optional variable" %}

If not specified, the default value applies:
`version: "0.1"`



{% endinfo_block %}

***

**namespace**:

Defines the namespace to separate different deployments in a single environment.

For example, Docker images, containers and volume names start with a `namespace:` to avoid intersections between different deployments on a single host machine.

```yaml
version: 1.0
namespace: spryker-demo
```
{% info_block infoBox "Optional variable" %}

If not specified, the default value applies:
`namespace: spryker`



{% endinfo_block %}
***

**tag**:

Defines a tag to separate different boots for a single deployment.

By default, the tag is a randomly generated, unique value.

For example, Docker images and volumes are tagged with a `tag:` to avoid intersections between different boots for a signle deployment on a single host machine. The tag can be set directly in the deploy file to ensure that all the boots of a deployment run with the same images and volumes.
```yaml
version: 1.0

tag: '1.0'
```
```yaml
version: 1.0

tag: 'custom-one'
```
{% info_block infoBox "Optional variable" %}

If not specified, the default value applies:
`tag: '1.0'`



{% endinfo_block %}

***

**environment**:

Defines the environment name for Spryker applications mainly to point to specific configuration files, namely `config/Shared/config-default_%environment_name%{store}.php`.

The `APPLICATION_ENV` environment variable is set for all the corresponding Spryker applications.
```yaml
version: 1.0

environment: 'docker'
```

{% info_block infoBox "Optional variable" %}

If not specified, the default value applies:
`environment: 'docker'`



{% endinfo_block %}

***

**image**:

Defines the Docker image to run Spryker applications in. It can be set according to tags for the `spryker/php` images located at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/spryker/php/tags). Possible values are:
1. `spryker/php:7.2` - applies the default image (currently, it is Debian).

2. `spryker/php:7.2-debian` - applies Debian as a base image.

3. `spryker/php:7.2-alpine` - applies Alpine as a base image. The Alpine images are smaller, but you may have issues with:
    * iconv
    * NFS
    * Non-lating languages
    * Tideways

```yaml
version: 1.0

image:  spryker/php:7.2
```

{% info_block infoBox "Optional variable" %}

If not specified, the default value applies:
`image: spryker/php:7.2`



{% endinfo_block %}
***

**regions**:

Defines the list of **Regions**.

<a name="regions-services"></a>
* `regions: services:` - defines settings for **Region**-specific `services:`. Only `database:` is currently allowed here.
* `regions: stores:` - defines the list of **Stores**.
<a name="regions-stores-services"></a>
* `regions: stores: services:` - defines application-wide, **Store**-specific settings for **Services**. Only `broker:`, `key_value_store:` and `search:` are currently allowed here. See [services:](#services-reference) to learn more.

```yaml
version: "1.0"

regions:
	REGION-1:
		services:
			# Region-specific services settings

		stores:
			STORE-1:
				services:
					# Store-specific services settings
			STORE-2:
				services:
					# Store-specific services settings

 ```

***

**groups**:

Defines the list of **Groups**.

* `groups: region:` - defines the relation to a **Region** by key.
* `groups: applications:` - defines the list of **Applications**. See [groups: applications:](#groups-applications) to learn more.

```yaml
version: "1.0"

groups:
	BACKEND-1:
		region: REGION-1
		applications:
			zed_1:
				application: zed
				endpoints:
					zed.store1.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-1
						services:
							# Application-Store-specific services settings
					zed.store2.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-2
						services:
							# Application-Store-specific services settings
	STOREFRONT-1:
		region: REGION-1
		applications:
			yves_1:
				application: yves
				endpoints:
					yves.store1.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-1
						services:
							# Application-Store-specific services settings
					yves.astore2t.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-2
						services:
							# Application-Store-specific services settings
			glue_1:
				application: glue
				endpoints:
					glue.store1.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-1
					glue.store2.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-2

 ```

Applications can be defined as **Store**-agnostic, as in the example above. Also, applications can be defined as **Store**-specific by leaving a single endpoint pointing to each application. You can see it in the example below. You can use both approaches to scale applications separately by **Store**.
```yaml
version: "1.0"

groups:
	BACKEND-1:
		region: REGION-1
		applications:
			zed_store_1:
				application: zed
				endpoints:
					zed.store1.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-1
			zed_store_2:
				application: zed
				endpoints:
					zed.store2.spryker.local:
						store: STORE-2

 ```

***
<a name="groups-applications"></a>
**groups: applications**:

Defines the list of **Applications**.

The key must be project-wide unique.

Each `application:` should contain the following:

* `groups: applications: application:` - defines the type of **Application**. Possible values are `Zed`, `Yves` and `Glue`.
