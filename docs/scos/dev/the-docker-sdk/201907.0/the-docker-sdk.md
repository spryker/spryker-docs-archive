## Description

Spryker Docker SDK helps to set up docker environment for your Spryker project.

Spryker Docker SDK requires the [Deploy file](/docs/scos/dev/docker-sdk/{{page.version}}/deploy-file-reference-1.0.html). The tool reads the specified Deploy file and builds a production-like Docker infrastructure for Spryker accordingly.

The purposes of the tool:

1. Building production-like Docker images.
2. Serving as a part of development environment based on Docker.
3. Simplifying the process of setting up a local demo of Spryker project.

## Installation

1. Fetch Docker SDK tools:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk.git ./docker
```

{% info_block warningBox %}

Make sure `docker 18.09.1+` and `docker-compose 1.23+` are installed in the local environment.

{% endinfo_block %}

2. Initialize docker setup:
 ```shell
docker/sdk bootstrap
```
3. Build and run Spryker applications:
```shell
docker/sdk up
```

{% info_block warningBox %}

Make sure all the domains from `deploy.yml` are defined as `127.0.0.1` in the `hosts` file in the local environment.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Getting Started

There are two ways to start working with Spryker in Docker:

* If you want to set up a new Spryker project in Docker, start with [Getting Started with Docker](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/installing-spryker-with-docker.html).
* If you already have a DevVM based project, proceed to [Integrating Docker into an Existing Project](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/installing-spryker-with-docker.html) to convert your project into a Docker based one.
