{% info_block infoBox "When to use query containers" %}

Don't use query containers to cross module boundaries, as this increases modules coupling. However, you can use them behind [Repository](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/zed/persistence-layer/repository.html) and [Entity Manager](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/zed/persistence-layer/entity-manager.html) as query aggregations.
Previously, query containers were used to cross module borders (via dependency providers), which led to higher module coupling and leaking of persistence layer from one domain object to another, and therefore, to higher maintenance efforts and lower code reusability. This approach has been deprecated now, so we don't recommend using query containers like this in your project development.

{% endinfo_block %}

A query container holds all the database queries of the current module.

Each module has exactly one query container, which also acts as an entry point to the persistence layer. Internally, it uses [query objects](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/zed/persistence-layer/query-objects-creation-and-usage.html) and returns unterminated queries.

As you can see in the example below, the query container consists of `query-methods` which gets [query objects](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/zed/persistence-layer/query-objects-creation-and-usage.html) from the [factory](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/factory/factory.html), adds some filters or joins and returns the unterminated query object.

Unterminated queries should be avoided in the Application Layers above Persistence. Consider using the [Repository](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/zed/persistence-layer/repository.html) and [Entity Manager](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/zed/persistence-layer/entity-manager.html) patterns to decouple persistence and ORM implementation details.

Unterminated means you donâ€™t execute the query with `find()`, `findOne()` or `count()`.

```php
use Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Persistence\AbstractQueryContainer;

/**
 * @method \Pyz\Zed\MyBundle\Persistence\MyBundlePersistenceFactory getFactory()
 */
class MyBundleQueryContainer extends AbstractQueryContainer implements MyBundleQueryContainerInterface
{
    public function queryTemplateByPath($path)
    {
        $query = $this->getFactory()->createTemplateQuery();
        $query->filterByTemplatePath($path);

        return $query;
    }
}
```
