The [list of console commands](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/console-commands/getting-the-list-of-console-commands-and-available-options.html) contains the command names together with a short description of what the command does. The most important commands in Spryker can be split into 4 categories : collector commands, order management system commands, setup commands, and frontend-related commands. This article provides details on each of the commands.

## Collector commands

Collector commands are responsible of exporting the data in the SQL database to the front-end data storages (Redis and Elasticsearch)

* `collector:search:export` - exports data to the Elasticsearch storage
* `collector:search:update` - updates the data in the Elasticsearch storage
* `collector:storage:export` - exports data to Key-Value storage (Redis)

## Order Management System commands

Check if conditions are satisfied for the orders that are in the state that is the source state for the transition that has a condition attached.

```bash
console oms:check-condition
```

Options:

* `-s`, `--store=store` - filter by the given store
* `-l`, `--limit=limit` - limit the number of orders

Examples:

```bash
$ console oms:check-condition -s DE
$ console oms:check-condition --limit=100 --store=DE
```

---
Check if timeout was reached for the orders that are in the state that is the source state for the transition that has a timeout attached.

```bash
console oms:check-timeout
```

Options:

* `-s`, `--store=store` - filter by the given store
* `-l`, `--limit=limit` - limit the number of orders

Examples:

```bash
$ console oms:check-timeout --store=DE --limit=100
$ console oms:check-timeout -l 100
```

## Installation setup commands

- Setup install runs a set of commands, necessary for installing or updating the application.

```bash
setup:install
```

  The following steps are performed when running this command:

  1. delete all cache files for all stores

  ```bash
  cache:delete-all
  ```

  2. remove the directory that contains the generated files, such as transfer classes, merged database schema XML files or autocompletion classes

  ```bash
  setup:remove-generated-directory
  ```

  3. create or migrate the database

  ```bash
  setup:propel
  ```

  4. generate transfer classes for each of the objects defined in the XML transfer files

  ```bash
  transfer:generate
  ```

  5. initialize the database with required data

  ```bash
  setup:init-db
  ```

  6. generate IDE auto-completion files to enable navigation to referenced classes (). Generated auto-completion classes will be found for each application under the generated folder.

```bash
dev:ide:generate-auto-completion
```

  7. build the project resources for Yves and Zed
  8. build the navigation tree

  ```bash
  application:build-navigation-tree
  ```

  {% info_block infoBox %}

  Each of the commands contained in the steps above can also be executed individually.

  {% endinfo_block %}

- This command inserts demo data into the database for testing reasons.

```bash
setup:install:demo-data
```

- Setup propel command runs a set of commands, necessary for creating or migrating the database.

```bash
setup:propel
```
  The following steps are performed when running this command:

  1. write propel configuration

  ```bash
  setup:propel:config:convert
  ```

  2. creates the database if it doesn’t exist yet, based on the configuration set in the previous step

  ```bash
  setup:propel:database:create
  ```

  3. ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL if necessary, by adjusting the Propel XML schema files

  ```bash
  setup:propel:pg-sql-compat
  ```

  4. copy schema files from Spryker and project packages to the generated folder

  ```bash
  setup:propel:schema:copy
  ```

  5. build Propel classes based on the XML schema files

  ```bash
  setup:propel:model:build
  ```

  6. compare the propel models with the database tables and generate the diff, in order to prepare for migration

  ```bash
  setup:propel:diff
  ```

  7. migrate the database: update the database so that’s in sync with the propel models in the project

  ```bash
  setup:propel:migrate
  ```

## Jenkins setup commands

Cron jobs are scheduled by using Jenkins. For setting up Jenkins, the following console commands can be used from the command line:

* starts the Jenkins service

```bash
scheduler:resume
```

* shuts down the Jenkins service

```bash
scheduler:suspend
```

* sets up the cron jobs based on the definitions contained in the configuration file (the config file for jobs is placed in `/config/Zed/cronjobs/jobs.php`)

```bash
scheduler:setup
```

* cleans Jenkins jobs

```bash
scheduler:clean
```

{% info_block infoBox "Git Commands" %}

Git commands are enabled through console commands and they have effect on the Spryker packages.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Frontend-related commands

Depending on your environments and needs, there is a number of commands you can run. The table below provides an overview of such commands.

{% info_block infoBox %}

To use the NPM commands, you need to download and install [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Minimum versions for Node.js is **8.x** and for NPM it is **5.x**. Then you can use the appropriate commands listed in the table.
