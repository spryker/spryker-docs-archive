{% info_block infoBox "Prepayment" %}
This article describes the steps that you need to consider when you need to implement the prepayment method without integrating with a third party payment service provider.
{% endinfo_block %}

In this HowTo section, we will add a new module called `PaymentMethods`.

If this is your first time creating a new module, see [Tutorial - Adding a New Module](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/extending-spryker/development-strategies/project-modules/adding-a-new-module.html).
