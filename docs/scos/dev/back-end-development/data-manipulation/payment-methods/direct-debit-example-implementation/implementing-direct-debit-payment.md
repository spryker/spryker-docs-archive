This set of articles will guide you through implementation of the Direct Debit payment method without integrating with a third party payment service provider.

The implementation process includes the following steps:

* [Implementation of Direct Debit in Yves](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/implementation-of-direct-debit-in-yves.html)
* [Integration of Direct Debit into the checkout](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/integrate-direct-debit-into-checkout.html)
* [Implementation of Direct Debit in Zed](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/implementation-of-direct-debit-in-zed.html)
* [Implementation of Direct Debit in the Shared layer](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/implementation-of-direct-debit-in-the-shared-layer.html)
* [Testing your Direct Debit Implementation](/docs/scos/dev/back-end-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/testing-your-direct-debit-implementation.html)

The order of the implementation steps does not really matter, however make sure you execute them all.
