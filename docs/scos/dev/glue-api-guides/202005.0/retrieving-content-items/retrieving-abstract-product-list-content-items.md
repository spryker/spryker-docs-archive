The **Abstract Product List API** implements resources allowing you to retrieve information on each abstract product included in the Abstract Product List content item available in the storage. The list consists of abstract products that come with concrete products (variants) and may have characteristic attributes, such as memory, brand or color, that help your customers distinguish your products and choose the one matching their needs.

In particular, you can:

* get a list of abstract products
* retrieve basic data on the abstract products related to the list
* get only specific details for abstract products
* view details of the abstract product and its variants
* check what image sets, product labels, and prices abstract products have
* retrieve information on categories abstract products are assigned to

In your development, these resources can help you get relevant information for your product list and the product detail pages for all or a specific locale.

{% info_block infoBox %}
See [Content Items](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/content-items.html
{% endinfo_block %} to learn how to create and manage content items in the Back Office.)

## Installation
For details on the modules that provide the API functionality and how to install them, see [Content Items API](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-content-items-feature-integration.html).

## Retrieving Abstract Product List Content Item Data
To retrieve the full information on the abstract product list by the content item key, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

_/content-product-abstract-lists/{content_item_key}/content-product-abstract_

Request sample: _GET http://mysprykershop.com/content-product-abstract-lists/apl-1/content-product-abstract_

where **content-product-abstract-lists** is the Abstract Product List content item type, **apl-1** is its key, and **content-product-abstract** is the abstract product list type.

{% info_block infoBox %}
The locale must be specified in the **header** of the GET request. If no locale is specified, data from the **default** locale will be returned.
{% endinfo_block %}

If the request is successful and the Abstract Product List content item with the specified content item key has been found, the endpoint will respond with a **RestAbstractProductsResponse**.

| Field* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|attributes  | string |List of the abstract product's attributes and their values.  |
| sku |string  | SKU of the abstract product. |
| name | string | Name of the abstract product. |
| description | string | Description of the abstract product. |
| attributes | string{} | List of all available attributes for the product. |

## Retrieving Other Resources for Abstract Product Lists
You can extend the response of the content-product-abstract endpoint with the following resource relationships:

* abstract-product-image-sets
* abstract-product-availabilities
* abstract-product-prices
* category-nodes
* product-tax-sets
* product-labels
* concrete-products

Please see below for details of the resource relationships.

### Getting Image Sets for Abstract Products
