With the help of the [Shopping Lists](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/shopping-lists-feature-overview/shopping-list.html) feature, company users can manage shopping lists for their company to plan purchasing activities beforehand. Unlike [Wishlists](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/wishlist-feature-overview.html), Shopping Lists contain not only a list of items to be purchased but also the quantity of each item.

The endpoints provided by the **Shopping List API** provide full *Shopping List management* functionality via REST requests.
{% info_block infoBox %}


Shopping lists are available in B2B scenarios only. This means that access to them is provided upon proper authentication as a **Company User**. For more details, see [Logging In as Company User](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-b2b-account/authenticating-as-a-company-user.html).

{% endinfo_block %}
In your development, the resources can help you to enable the shopping list functionality in your application.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Glue API: Shopping Lists Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-shopping-lists-feature-integration.html).
