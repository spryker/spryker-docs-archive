The Discount API enables shop owners to add free value to their customers by discounting a percentage or a fixed sum of an order's subtotal or an item's price. Discounts can be applied to a purchase in **2** ways:

1. Discounts applied to carts based on certain conditions, called [cart rules](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/merchandising/discount/creating-cart-rules.html#creating-a-cart-rule-discount);
2. Price reductions provided when redeeming a [discount voucher](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/merchandising/discount/creating-vouchers.html).

Discounts provided based on *cart rules* are calculated and taken into account automatically. *Vouchers*, on the other hand, need to be applied by customers explicitly. For this purpose, the *Discounts API* allows:

* applying a voucher to a certain purchase contained in a specific cart;
* retrieving the discounted amount of the purchase;
* checking which vouchers and cart rules are applied to a certain purchase;
* removing a voucher from a cart.

In your development, the API will help you to enable customers to apply voucher discounts to their purchases and check the correct order amount, discount included.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [GLUE: Promotions & Discounts Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-promotions-and-discounts-feature-integration.html).

## Applying Discount Vouchers
To apply a discount voucher, first, a customer needs to have a cart with some products in it.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

For details on how to manage carts, see [Managing Carts](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/managing-carts.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

### Request
To apply a discount voucher to a cart, you need to send it via a *POST* request to the following endpoints:

* **/carts/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}uuid{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/vouchers** - for carts of registered users;

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication" %}

Carts of registered users cannot be accessed anonymously. For this reason, you always need to pass a user's authentication token when accessing the endpoint. For details on how to authenticate a user and retrieve the token, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

* **/guest-carts/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}uuid{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/vouchers** - for guest carts.

{% info_block warningBox "Anonymous User ID" %}

When accessing guest carts, you need to specify the guest user ID. This is done via the `X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id` header. Guest user IDs are managed by the API Client. For details, see [Managing Guest Carts](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/guest-carts/managing-guest-carts.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

Sample request: `POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts/1ce91011-8d60-59ef-9fe0-4493ef3628b2/vouchers`

where **1ce91011-8d60-59ef-9fe0-4493ef3628b2** is the UUID of the customer’s cart.

{% info_block warningBox "Verification" %}

You can also include the vouchers resource relationship to obtain detailed information on the discount provided by the voucher in the response data. Example: `POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts/1ce91011-8d60-59ef-9fe0-4493ef3628b2/vouchers?include=vouchers`

{% endinfo_block %}

**Request Attributes**

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **code** | String | yes | Specifies the voucher code to apply.  |

**Request Sample**

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "vouchers",
        "attributes": {
            "code": "mydiscount-qa1ma"
        }
    }
}
```

### Response
The endpoints respond with information on the cart to which the discount is applied. Brief voucher information is available in the **discounts** section.

{% info_block warningBox "Verification" %}

If you included the `vouchers` resource relationship in your request URL, the response will also contain detailed voucher information, including the amount of discount applied, price reduction calculation, etc.

### Removing Vouchers

**Request**
To unapply a discount voucher, send a DELETE request to the following endpoints:

* **/carts/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}uuid{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/vouchers/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}voucher_id{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}** - for carts of registered users;

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication" %}

Carts of registered users cannot be accessed anonymously. For this reason, you always need to pass a user's authentication token when accessing the endpoint. For details on how to authenticate a user and retrieve the token, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

* **/guest-carts/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}uuid{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/vouchers/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}voucher_id{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}** - for guest carts.

{% info_block warningBox "Anonymous User ID" %}

When accessing guest carts, you need to specify the guest user ID. This is done via the `X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id` header. Guest user IDs are managed by the API Client. For details, see [Managing Guest Carts](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/guest-carts/managing-guest-carts.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

Sample request: `DELETE http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts/1ce91011-8d60-59ef-9fe0-4493ef3628b2/vouchers/mydiscount-we3ca`

where:

* `1ce91011-8d60-59ef-9fe0-4493ef3628b2` - is the UUID of the customer’s cart;
* `mydiscount-we3ca` - is the voucher ID.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

The **voucher ID** can be retrieved when viewing voucher information. Typically, it is the same as the *voucher code*.

### Response
If the voucher is deleted successfully, the endpoints respond with the **204 No Data** status code.

### Possible Errors
