Spryker provides the [Company Account](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/company-account-feature-overview/company-accounts-overview.html) feature that allows purchasing goods and performing other actions on behalf of a user's company. The endpoints provided by the Company API allow retrieving information on companies.

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication" %}

The endpoints provided by this API cannot be accessed anonymously. To access them, you need to impersonate users as Company Accounts and pass the authentication tokens received. For details on how to authenticate and retrieve such a token, see [Logging In as Company User](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-b2b-account/authenticating-as-a-company-user.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

In your development, the API can help you to provide information on the company that the authenticated user belongs to.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Glue API: Company Account Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-company-account-feature-integration.html).

## Retrieving Company Information
### Information on the User's Company
To retrieve information on the company a user belongs to, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

/companies/mine

Request sample: *GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/companies/mine*

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

You can use the Accept-Language header to specify the locale.Sample header: [{"key":"Accept-Language","value":"de, en;q=0.9"}]where de, en are the locales; q=0.9 is the user's preference for a specific locale. For details, see [14.4 Accept-Language](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4).

{% endinfo_block %}

#### Response

The endpoint responds with a collection of **RestCompanyResponse** consisting of a single item that represents the user's company.

**Response Attributes:**

| Attribute* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | Specifies the name of the Company. |
| isActive | Boolean | Indicates whether the Company is active. |
| status | String | Specifies the status of the Company. Possible values: *Pending*, *Approved*, or *Denied*. |

*The attributes mentioned are all attributes in the response. Type and ID are not mentioned.

### Information on a Specific Company

To retrieve information on a specific company, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

/companies/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}company_id{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}

Request sample: *GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/companies/**59b6c025-cc00-54ca-b101-191391adf2af***
where **59b6c025-cc00-54ca-b101-191391adf2af** is the ID of the company you need.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

The endpoint provides information only on the companies a user has access to. If an attempt is made to access a company that a user doesn't have access to, the endpoint will respond with a **404 Not Found** error code.

{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

You can use the Accept-Language header to specify the locale.Sample header: [{"key":"Accept-Language","value":"de, en;q=0.9"}]where de, en are the locales; q=0.9 is the user's preference for a specific locale. For details, see [14.4 Accept-Language](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4).
