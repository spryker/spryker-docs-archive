[Product labels](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-labels-feature-overview.html) are used to draw your customers' attention to some specific products. Each of them has a name, a priority, and a validity period. The Product Labels API provides endpoints for getting labels via the REST HTTP requests.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
Product labels are available only for abstract products.
{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see Product Labels API. <!-- link to IG -->

## Get Product Label by ID
To retrieve a product label, send the following GET request:

**/product-labels/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}label-id{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}**

Request sample: *GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/product-labels/3*

where **3** is the ID of the label you want to retrieve.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
Label IDs can be found in the **Products / Product Labels** section of the Back Office.
{% endinfo_block %}

![Product Labels](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Glue+API/Glue+API+Storefront+Guides/Managing+Products/Accessing+Product+Labels/product_labels_2.png)

### Response
The endpoint responds with information on the requested product label, including the CSS class that can be used to display the label on a storefront.

**Attributes**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | String | Specifies the label name. |
| **isExclusive** | Boolean | Indicates whether the label is **exclusive**.<br>If the attribute is set to true, the current label takes precedence over other labels the product might have. This means that only the current label should be displayed for the product, and all other possible labels should be hidden. |
| **position** | Integer | Indicates the label priority.<br>Labels should be indicated on the frontend according to their priority, from the highest (**1**) to the lowest, unless a product has a label with the **isExclusive** attribute set.|
| **frontEndReference** | String |Specifies the label custom label type (CSS class).<br>If the attribute is an empty string, the label should be displayed using the default CSS style. |

**Sample**

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "product-labels",
        "id": "3",
        "attributes": {
            "name": "Standard Label",
            "isExclusive": false,
            "position": 3,
            "frontEndReference": ""
        },
        "links": {
            "self": "http://glue.mysprykershop.com/product-labels/3"
        }
    }
}
```

### Possible errors
| Code | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Product label ID is not specified. |
| 404 | A label with the specified ID does not exist. |

## Get Product Labels by Product
To retrieve all labels for a product, send a GET request to the following endpoints and include **product-labels** as relationship:

* **/abstract-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}product-sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}?include=product-labels** - for *abstract* products;
* **/abstract-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}product-sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/related-products?include=product-labels** - for *related* products;
* **/concrete-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}product-sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}?include=product-labels** - for *concrete* products;
* **/concrete-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}product-sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/abstract-alternative-products?include=product-labels** - for *abstract alternative* products;
* **/concrete-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}product-sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/concrete-alternative-products?include=product-labels** - for *concrete alternative* products.

Request sample: *GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/abstract-products/001?include=product-labels*

where **001** is the SKU of the product you need labels for.

**Response**
The endpoint responds with information on the requested product, and the labels are available in the requested relationship. For each assigned label, the attributes are the same as when requesting that specific label.

## Get Product Labels for Wishlist Items
To retrieve labels for all products in a wishlist, send a GET request to the following endpoints and include **product-labels** as a relationship:

* */wishlists?include=wishlist-items,concrete-products,product-labels* - **all** wishlists of a customer;
* */wishlists/**{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}wishlist_ID{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}**?include=wishlist-items,concrete-products,product-labels* - specific wishlist.

Request sample: `GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/wishlists/19154981-f490-56b5-9537-359703a2ed08?include=wishlist-items,concrete-products,product-labels`

where **19154981-f490-56b5-9537-359703a2ed08** is the ID of the wishlist you need labels for.

{% info_block warningBox "Performance" %}
The above requests fetch not only label information, but also information on the products in the wishlist. That can adversely affect the overall performance. Use them with caution and apply caching, where possible.
{% endinfo_block %}

### Response
The endpoint responds with information on the requested wishlist, including the products in it and the labels assigned to them. For each assigned label, the attributes are the same as when requesting that specific label.
