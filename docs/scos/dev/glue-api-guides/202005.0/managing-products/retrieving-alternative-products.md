The _Alternative Products_ feature allows customers to quickly find a substitute product in case if their preferred item runs out of stock or is no longer available for other reasons. The feature is particularly useful when a certain product becomes discontinued. In this case, customers usually look for a more up-to-date generation of the same product, and suggesting possible alternatives is especially crucial.

For more details, see [Alternative Products](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/alternative-products-feature-overview.html) and [Discontinued Products](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-feature-overview/discontinued-products-overview.html).

The Product Alternatives API provides access to alternative products via REST API requests. In particular, you can:

* Find out whether a concrete product is discontinued.
* Retrieve a list of alternative products of a product.

Only concrete products can be marked as discontinued and, therefore, alternatives can be specified for concrete products only.

In your development, the endpoints can help you to:

* Provide alternatives to a customer if a desired product runs out or unavailable, for example, due to local restrictions.
* Provide alternatives in case a certain product is discontinued.
* Make alternative products available to customers in their shopping list or suggestions area in order to make searching for and comparing similar products easier. This can significantly enhance the shopping experience in your shop.

{% info_block errorBox %}
It is the responsibility of the client to identify whether a product is unavailable and when to provide alternatives. The API only provides information on availability, discontinued status and possible alternatives.
{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Glue API: Alternative Products Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-alternative-products-feature-integration.html).

{% info_block infoBox %}
To be able to use **Product Alternatives API**, first, you need to have the _Alternative Products_ feature integrated with your project.<br>To be able to handle discontinued products, first, integrate the _Discontinued Products_ feature.
{% endinfo_block %}

## Managing Products
Retrieving Alternative Products
The Alternative Products feature allows customers to quickly find a substitute product in case if their preferred item runs out of stock or is no longer available for other reasons. The feature is particularly useful when a certain product becomes discontinued. In this case, customers usually seek for a more up-to-date generation of the same product, and suggesting possible alternatives is especially crucial.

For more details, see Alternative Products and Discontinued Products.

The Product Alternatives API provides access to alternative products via REST API requests. In particular, you can:

Find out whether a specific concrete product is discontinued;
Retrieve a list of alternative products for a specific product.
Only concrete products can be marked as discontinued and, therefore, alternatives can be specified for concrete products only.

In your development, the endpoints can help you to:

Provide alternatives to a customer in the case when a desired product runs out of stock or is otherwise unavailable, for example, due to local restrictions;
Provide replacements in case a certain product is discontinued;
Make alternative products available to customers in their shopping list or suggestions area in order to make searching for and comparing similar products easier. This can significantly enhance the shopping experience in your shop.
It is the responsibility of the client to identify whether a product is unavailable and when to provide alternatives. The API only provides information on availability, discontinued status and possible alternatives.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Checking Whether Product is Discontinued
Before suggesting an alternative product, first, check if a product is still available, for example, not discontinued. To check if a product is discontinued, see [Retrieve Concrete Products](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-products/retrieving-product-information.html#retrieve-concrete-products).
