The Wishlists API provides REST access to managing [wishlists](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/wishlist-feature-overview.html) of a customer. With the help of the endpoints provided by the API, you can create, list and delete wishlists, as well as manage the items inside them.

In your development, these resources can help you to enable complete wishlist functionality for your customers.

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication " %}
Since wishlists are available for registered users only, the endpoints provided by the API cannot be accessed anonymously. For this reason, you always need to pass a user's authentication token in your REST requests. For details on how to authenticate a user and retrieve the token, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).
{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Wishlist API Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-wishlist-feature-integration.html).

## Creating a Wishlist
To create a wishlist for a registered user, you need to send a POST request to the following endpoint:
`/wishlists`
Sample request: `POST http://mysprykershop.com/wishlists`
**Attributes:**
* **name** - sets a name for the new wishlist.

**Sample request body**
```js
{
		"data":{
			"type": "wishlists",
			"attributes":{
				"name":"{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}my_name{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}"
			}
		}
	}
```

**Sample Response:**
| Field* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | Name of the wishlist |
| numberOfItems | Integer | Number of items in the wishlist |
| createdAt | String | Creation date of the wishlist |
| updatedAt | String | Date of the last update |

\*The fields mentioned are all attributes in the response. Type and ID are not mentioned.

**Sample response**
```js
{
		"data": {
			"type": "wishlists",
			"id": "09264b7f-1894-58ed-81f4-d52d683e910a",
			"attributes": {
				"name": "Name of the wishlist",
				"numberOfItems": 0,
				"createdAt": "2018-08-17 10:04:35.311557",
				"updatedAt": "2018-08-17 10:04:35.311557"
			},
			"links": {
				"self": "http://mysprykershop.com/wishlists/09264b7f-1894-58ed-81f4-d52d683e910a"
			}
		}
	}
```

The response contains a unique identifier, contained in the id attribute, and a self link that can be used to access the wishlist later.

### Possible errors

| --- | --- |
| 202 | A wishlist with the same name already exists. |

## Accessing Wishlists of User
To access all wishlists of a user, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

	}
```
If there are any wishlists already created for a user, they will be returned in the **data** attribute of the response.

{
		"data": {


	{
