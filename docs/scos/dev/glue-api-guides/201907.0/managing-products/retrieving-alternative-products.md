The _Alternative Products_ feature allows customers to quickly find a substitute product in case if their preferred item runs out of stock or is no longer available for other reasons. The feature is particularly useful when a certain product becomes discontinued. In this case, customers usually seek for a more up-to-date generation of the same product, and suggesting possible alternatives is especially crucial.

{% info_block infoBox %}
For more details, see [Alternative Products](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/alternative-products-feature-overview.html
{% endinfo_block %} and [Discontinued Products](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}product-feature-overview/discontinued-products-overview.html).)

The Product Alternatives API provides access to alternative products via REST API requests. In particular, you can:

* Find out whether a specific concrete product is discontinued;
* Retrieve a list of alternative products for a specific product.

{% info_block warningBox %}
Only **concrete** products can be marked as discontinued and, therefore, alternatives can be specified for **concrete** products only.
{% endinfo_block %}

In your development, the endpoints can help you to:

* Provide alternatives to a customer in the case when a desired product runs out of stock or is otherwise unavailable, for example, due to local restrictions;
* Provide replacements in case a certain product is discontinued;
* Make alternative products available to customers in their shopping list or suggestions area in order to make searching for and comparing similar products easier. This can significantly enhance the shopping experience in your shop.

{% info_block errorBox %}
It is the responsibility of the client to identify whether a product is unavailable and when to provide alternatives. The API only provides information on availability, discontinued status and possible alternatives.
{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see Alternative Products.

{% info_block infoBox %}
To be able to use **Product Alternatives API**, first, you need to have the _Alternative Products_ feature integrated with your project.<br>To be able to handle discontinued products, first, integrate the _Discontinued Products_ feature.

Retrieving Alternative Products
The Alternative Products feature allows customers to quickly find a substitute product in case if their preferred item runs out of stock or is no longer available for other reasons. The feature is particularly useful when a certain product becomes discontinued. In this case, customers usually seek for a more up-to-date generation of the same product, and suggesting possible alternatives is especially crucial.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Checking Whether Product is Discontinued
Before suggesting an alternative product, first, you need to identify whether a product is still available, for example, not discontinued. For this purpose, the response of the `/concrete-products` endpoint has been extended with the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| isDiscontinued | Boolean | Specifies whether a product is discontinued:<br>**true** - the product is discontinued and requires a replacement item; <br> **false** - the product is not discontinued. |
| discontinuedNote | String | Contains an optional note that was specified when marking a product as discontinued. |

{% info_block warningBox %}
Only **concrete** products can be marked as discontinued.
{% endinfo_block %}

To find out whether a product is discontinued, send a GET request to the endpoint:

`/concrete-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %} `
Retrieves information on a **concrete** product by SKU.

Sample request: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/concrete-products/145_29885470`
where `145_29885470` is the SKU of the concrete product.

If the request was successful and a product with the specified SKU was found, the resource responds with a `RestConcreteProductsResponse`. Sample response (truncated) with the `isDiscontinued` and `discontinuedNote` fields populated:

## Retrieving Alternatives for Product
To retrieve alternatives for a product, send a GET request to the following endpoints:

* `/concrete-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/abstract-alternative-products` - gets **abstract** products that substitute the item whose SKU is specified;
* `/concrete-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/concrete-alternative-products` - gets **concrete** products that substitute the item whose SKU is specified.

Sample request: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/concrete-products/145_29885470/abstract-alternative-products`
where `145_29885470` is the SKU of the product you are searching alternatives for.

{% info_block warningBox %}
Alternatives are available only for **concrete** products.
{% endinfo_block %}

### Response
Depending on the endpoint used, the request will be either an **AbstractProductsRestCollectionResponse** or a **ConcreteProductsRestCollectionResponse**:

* `AbstractProductsRestCollectionResponse` - represents a collection, where each item is an **abstract** alternative to the product requested;
* `ConcreteProductsRestCollectionResponse` - represents a collection, where each item is a **concrete** alternative to the product requested.
