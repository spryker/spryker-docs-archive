Different Product resources allow you to retrieve all the product information available in your storage. These resources follow the same hierarchical structure that [exists as a basis in the Spryker Commerce OS](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-feature-overview/product-feature-overview.html). Products can come with multiple Variants (Concrete products) and have Availability, Prices, Tax Sets, as well as Image Sets. Furthermore, you can see what category your product belongs to or what product label is available.

In your development, these resources can help you to retrieve relevant information for your product listing and detail pages, for search, shopping cart, checkout, order history, wishlist and many more.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Products API](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/products-feature-integration.html).

## Abstract and Concrete Products
As Spryker Commerce OS implements product data in a hierarchical structure, this concept is also implemented in the [Product API](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/products-feature-integration.html). The API provides separate endpoints for abstract and concrete products. Their names contain the abstract and concrete words, respectively.

## General Product Information
To retrieve full information about a product (regardless of whether it is available or not) via REST, use the endpoints listed below.
`/abstract-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}`
Retrieves information on an abstract product by SKU.
Request sample: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/abstract-products/001`
where `001` is the SKU of the abstract product.

| Field* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sku | String | SKU of the abstract product |
| name | String | Name of the abstract product |
| description | String | Description of the abstract product |
| attributes | Object | Dist of attributes and their values |
| superAttributeDefinition | String[] | Attributes flagged as super attributes, that are however not relevant to distinguish between the product variants |
| attributeMap|Object|Each super attribute / value combination and the corresponding concrete product IDs are listed here|
|attributeMap.super_attributes|Object|Applicable super attribute and its values for the product variants|
|attributeMap.attribute_variants|Object|List of super attributes with the list of values|
|attributeMap.product_concrete_ids|String[]|Product IDs of the product variants|
|metaTitle|String|Meta title of the product|
|metaKeywords|String|Meta keywords of the product.|
|metaDescription|String|Meta description of the product.|
|attributeNames | Object | All non-super attribute / value combinations for the abstract product. |
\*The fields mentioned are all attributes in the response. Type and ID are not mentioned.

If the request was successful and a product with the specified SKU was found, the resource responds with a **RestAbstractProductsResponse**. :

{% info_block errorBox "Performance" %}
By default, the response contains additional product information as relationships (e.g. product image sets, availability, prices, and categories.
{% endinfo_block %} The abstract product resource also contains information on the relevant concrete products and tax sets. For performance reasons and bandwidth usage optimization, it is recommended to filter out all information irrelevant to a specific use case. Examples:<ul><li>`/abstract-products/001?fields[abstract-products]=name,description` - return abstract product name and description only;</li><li>`/abstract-products/001?include=abstract-product-prices` - return abstract product information and prices;</li><li>`/abstract-products/001?include=concrete-products&fields[concrete-products]=name,description` - return abstract product information as well as name and description of each concrete product it relates to.</li></ul>)

## Availability
To find out how many items of a certain product are available, use the following endpoints:
`/abstract-products/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/abstract-product-availabilities`
Retrieves the availability of an abstract product by SKU.
Request sample: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/abstract-products/001/abstract-product-availabilities`
where `001` is the SKU of the abstract product.

| Field* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| availability | Boolean | Boolean to inform about the availability |
| quantity | Integer | Available stock (all warehouses aggregated) |

\*The fields mentioned are all attributes in the response. Type and ID are not mentioned.
If the request was successful, the resource responds with a **RestAbstractProductAvailabilityResponse**.
