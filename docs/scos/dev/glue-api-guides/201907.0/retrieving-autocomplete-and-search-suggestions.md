In addition to the catalog search, Elasticsearch also offers auto-completion terms and suggestions for products, categories and CMS pages that can be retrieved via the search suggestions endpoint. Auto-completion helps to predict the rest of the search string and provides you with all the options.

In your development, this resource can help you to retrieve relevant information for your product listing and detail pages, for search, shopping cart, checkout, order history, wishlist and many more.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Catalog Search API Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/catalog-search-api-feature-integration.html).

## Usage
To get search suggestion that you can use for auto-completion, you need to send GET requests to the following endpoint:
`/catalog-search-suggestions `
Request sample: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/catalog-search-suggestions`
To include search queries in your request, use the q parameter. Below you can find the most common queries to use:

| Request | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /catalog-search-suggestions?q= | Suggestions with empty search string |
| /catalog-search-suggestions?q=**c** | Suggestions for **1** letter |
| /catalog-search-suggestions?q=c**o** | Suggestions for **2** letters |
| /catalog-search-suggestions?q=com | Suggestions for **3** letters |
| /catalog-search-suggestions?q=**computer** | Suggestions for word **computers** |
| /catalog-search-suggestions?q=telecom+%26+navigation | Suggestions for "**telekom&navigation**" |

If the catalog contains any suggestions for the query string, the endpoint will respond with a **RestCatalogSearchSuggestionsResponse**.
