The **Checkout API** provides endpoints for placing, updating and retrieving checkout information.

In order to create a checkout experience, we offer an endpoint that allows placing orders and an additional endpoint that allows retrieving and updating checkout information. The data exposed by the endpoints is based not only on the shopping cart that is being checked out but also on the customers themselves. For registered customers, the API provides their registered addresses as well as the applicable payment and shipment methods.

If necessary, checkout data can be updated each time additional checkout information is provided. For example, for the purposes of fraud protection, specific payment methods can be disallowed for certain delivery addresses. In this case, a second call may be necessary to perform verification of payment method restrictions.

Apart from that, the API also supports redirecting to third party websites for additional checkout procession. Such a possibility may be needed, for example, when a customer pays with the help of an external payment system. For this purpose, the API allows generating a payload in the format and with the data as required by the third party, as well as processing the response received from it.

{% info_block errorBox %}
It is the responsibility of the API Client to redirect to the third party web site, send the payload and receive it (if necessary). The API is only responsible for generating a redirect URL, as well as generating and processing the payloads.
{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Checkout API Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/front-end-development/yves/atomic-frontend/managing-the-components/creating-a-component.html).

## Checkout Workflow
There are three endpoints provided to implement checkout via the API:
* `/checkout-data` - allows submitting checkout data as many times as you need. Using the endpoint, you can implement checkout steps in your Glue API client, perform verification steps and execute other operations that require multiple calls to complete. The endpoint does not allow placing an order.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
For usage information, see section *Submitting Checkout Data*.
{% endinfo_block %}

* `/checkout` - finalizes the checkout process and places an order. The cart is deleted automatically, and you cannot make any changes in the checkout data. Thus, the endpoint can be used for checkouts that can be performed in one pass or for finalizing a checkout after using `/checkout-data`.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
For usage information, see section *Placing Orders*.
{% endinfo_block %}

The endpoint also provides information on whether it is necessary to redirect the user to a third party page to complete the payment.

* `/order-payments` - allows completing the payment with payment verification on a third party page.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
For usage information, see sections *Redirecting the User for Payment Confirmation* and *Updating Payment Data*.
{% endinfo_block %}

A typical API Client workflow is as follows:
![Workflow](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Glue+API/Glue+API+Storefront+Guides/Checking+Out+Purchases+and+Getting+Checkout+Data/checkout-payment-process.png)

## Submitting Checkout Data
To submit checkout data without order confirmation, you need to use the `/checkout-data` endpoint:

/checkout-data

Request sample: *POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/checkout-data*

### Request
A request should contain the ID of the customer's cart that is being checked out. All other fields are optional.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
To submit a request, the customer needs to have at least one cart with products in it.
{% endinfo_block %}

```

In your request, you can use the addresses stored in a customer's account rather than specify them explicitly. To do so, pass the address identifier as a part of the **billingAddress** or the **shippingAddress** fields.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
The address identifiers will be available in the **addresses** field of the endpoint response. For details, see subsection *Response*.<br>You can also retrieve the IDs by querying the `/customers/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}customer_reference{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/addresses` endpoint. For details, see [Managing Customers](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-customers/managing-customers.html).
{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
The following address parts are compulsory: **salutation**, **firstName**, **lastName**, **address1**, **address2**, **zipCode**, **city**, **iso2Code**. If you are using an address ID, you can pass dummy values for the address parts. When resolving the ID, they will be replaced with the actual values of the customer account.
{% endinfo_block %}

**Body Sample**

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "checkout-data",
        "attributes": {
            "idCart": "d69fc8d2-acc9-5b32-81b6-103618e94fc9",
            "billingAddress": {
                "id": "22d78681-9885-5b47-8916-42f9e72b29ff",
                "salutation": "dummyValue",

                "iso2Code": "dummyValue"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**User Identification**
In order to access the endpoint, you need to identify the user whose cart you are checking out:
* If you are checking out a cart of a registered user, you need to include the user's authorization token in the request. 
* If you are checking out a guest cart, you need to include the guest user identifier in the **X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** header. For details, see [Managing Guest Carts](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/guest-carts/managing-guest-carts.html).

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
You can also use the **Accept-Language** header to specify the locale.<br>Sample header: `[{"key":"Accept-Language","value":"de, en;q=0.9"}]` where **de** and **en** are the locales; **q=0.9** is the user's preference for a specific locale. For details, see [14.4 Accept-Language](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4).
{% endinfo_block %}

### Response
In case of a successful update, the endpoint responds with information that can help you fill in the missing checkout data, such as the customer's addresses, available payment and shipment methods, etc.

## Selecting Payment and Shipment Methods
During checkout, customers need to specify the payment and shipment details for their purchases. For this purpose, they need to specify, for each purchase, the payment provider and the payment method, as well as the shipment method. To facilitate their choice, the endpoints allow you to retrieve the lists of the providers available in the system so that you can display them to the customer.

If you opt to fetch such information, the details include not only the provider names but also such details as the availability, cost, duration of shipment and other important pieces of information that can help customers in making their choice.

To fetch the available payment methods, include the **payment-methods** resource relationship in the response of the *checkout-data* endpoint:
**POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/checkout-data?include=payment-methods**

| Attribute* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | Shipment method name. |
| carrierName | String | Carrier name. |
| deliveryTime | Integer | Estimated delivery time. |
| defaultGrossPrice | Integer | Default gross price, in cents. |
| defaultNetPrice | Integer | Default net price, in cents. |
| currencyIsoCode | String | ISO 4217 code of the currency in which the prices are specified. |

To further assist users with selecting the payment and shipment methods they want to use, you can sort them by any attribute. For this purpose, use the **sort** URL parameter in your requests. For example, you can request sorting of shipment methods by price to help users select the cheapest one.

| Sort Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| sort=attribute | Sort by attribute, **ascending**. |
| sort=-attribute | Sort by attribute, **descending**. |
| sort=attribute1,-attribute2 | Sort by 2 parameters:<ul><li>attribute1, **ascending**.</li><li>attribute2, **descending**.</li></ul> |

In the following example request, shipment methods are sorted by attributes carrierName (**ascending**) and defaultNetPrice (**descending**):

**POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/checkout-data?include=shipment-methods&sort=shipment-methods.carrierName,-shipment-methods.defaultNetPrice**

If the payment and/or shipment methods have been specified in the request to the /checkout-data endpoint, they are returned in the `selectedPaymentMethods` and the `selectedShipmentMethods` attribute, respectively:

In your request, you can use the addresses stored in a customer's account rather than specify them explicitly. To do so, pass the address identifier as a part of the **billingAddress** or the **shippingAddress** fields.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
The address identifiers will be available in the **addresses** field  of the `/checkout-data` endpoint response. For details, see subsection *Response*.<br>You can also retrieve the IDs by querying the `/customers/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}customer_reference{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}/addresses` endpoint. For details, see [Managing Customers](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-customers/managing-customers.html).
{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
The following address parts are compulsory: **salutation**, **firstName**, **lastName**, **address1**, **address2**, **zipCode**, **city**, **iso2Code**. If you are using an address ID, you can pass dummy values for the address parts. The **iso2Code** must be a valid code, for example, DE. When resolving the ID, they will be replaced with the actual values of the customer account.

### Possible Errors

| Status | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad request. This error can occur due to the following reasons:<ul><li>The POST data is incorrect;</li><li>Neither **Authorization** nor **X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** headers were provided in the request.</li></ul> |
| 422 | The checkout data is incorrect. |

## Redirecting the User for Payment Confirmation
When placing an order, you need to check the value of the **redirectURL** attribute. If the value is null or empty, this means that the payment method selected by the customer does not require additional verification. If verification is necessary, the attribute will contain a URL to redirect the customer to.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
It is the responsibility of the API Client to redirect the customer to the page and capture the response. For information on how to process it, see information on the payment service provider's API.
{% endinfo_block %}

The formats of the payloads used in the request and response to the third party page are defined by the respective **Eco** layer module that implements the interaction with the payment provider. For details, see section **3. Implement Payload Processor Plugin** in [Interacting with Third Parties via Glue API](/docs/scos/dev/tutorials-and-howtos/advanced-tutorials/glue-api/tutorial-interacting-with-third-party-payment-providers-via-glue-api.html#implement-payload-processor-plugin).

## Updating Payment Data
If the user is redirected to a third-party page for payment verification, you need to update the payment with the payload received from the payment provider. To do so, post the payload to the following endpoint:

/order-payments

Request sample: *POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/order-payments*

### Request
Your request should contain the payload related to the order. The request can include an optional payment identifier, if necessary.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
The identifier is specified in the **orderReference** attribute of the `/checkout` endpoint response.
{% endinfo_block %}

**Attributes**

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| paymentIdentifier | String | x | Payment ID.<br>The value of the payment identifier depends on the payment services provider plugin used to process the payment. For details, see section **3. Implement Payload Processor Plugin** in [Interacting with Third Parties via Glue API](/docs/scos/dev/tutorials-and-howtos/advanced-tutorials/glue-api/tutorial-interacting-with-third-party-payment-providers-via-glue-api.html#implement-payload-processor-plugin). |
| dataPayload | Array | v | Payload received from the payment service provider. |

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
You can also use the **Accept-Language** header to specify the locale.<br>Sample header: `[{"key":"Accept-Language","value":"de, en;q=0.9"}]` where **de** and **en** are the locales; **q=0.9** is the user's preference for a specific locale. For details, see [14.4 Accept-Language](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4).
{% endinfo_block %}

**Sample Request Body**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "order-payments",
    "attributes": {
      "paymentIdentifier": "1ce91011-8d60-59ef-9fe0-4493ef36bbfe",

         }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Response
If the request was successful, the endpoint will respond with a 201 Created status code and a new payload, if it is necessary to pass it to a third party provider. If there is no new payload, the **dataPayload** is null.

**Response Attributes:**

| Attribute* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| paymentIdentifier | String | Payment ID |
| dataPayload | Array | Payload |

*The attributes mentioned are all attributes in the response. Type and ID are not mentioned.
