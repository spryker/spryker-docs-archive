For every registered customer, there is an order history retrievable. The list of orders, as well as detailed order information including every step of the calculation and addresses used in the orders, is available for retrieval.

In your development, this resource can help you to:

* Make the order history available to customers
* Make order details available to enable reordering functionality

The **Order History API** allows you to retrieve all orders made by a registered customer.

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication" %}
Since order history is available for registered users only, the endpoints provided by the API cannot be accessed anonymously. For this reason, you always need to pass a user's authentication token in your REST requests. For details on how to authenticate a user and retrieve the token, see [Authentication and Authorization]().
{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see Order History API.

## Getting Customer's Orders
To retrieve a list of all orders made by a registered customer, send a GET request to the following endpoint:
`/orders`
Sample request: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/orders`
**Sample Response:**

| Field* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| createdAt | String | Date and time when the order was created. |
| expenseTotal | Integer | Total amount of expenses (e.g. shipping costs). |
| discountTotal | Integer | Total amount of discounts applied to the order. |
| taxTotal | Integer | Total amount of taxes paid. |
| subtotal | Integer | Subtotal of the order. |
| grandTotal | Integer | Grand total of the order. |
| canceledTotal | Integer | Total canceled amount. |
| currencyIsoCode | String | Currency that was selected when placing the order. |
| priceMode | String | Price mode that was active when placing the order. |

\*The fields mentioned are all attributes in the response. Type and ID are not mentioned.
 

The endpoint responds with a RestOrdersResponse. The following is an example of a response for a customer that has placed 1 order:

**Response sample:**
```js
{
		"data": [
			{
				"type": "orders",
				"id": "DE--1",
				"attributes": {
					"createdAt": "2018-11-01 17:57:14.354849",
					"totals": {
						"expenseTotal": 490,
						"discountTotal": 30237,
						"taxTotal": 42746,
						"subtotal": 297470,
						"grandTotal": 267723,
						"canceledTotal": 0
					},
					"currencyIsoCode": "EUR",
					"priceMode": "GROSS_MODE"
				},
				"links": {
					"self": "http://mysprykershop.com/orders/DE--1"
				}
			}
		],
		"links": {
			"self": "http://mysprykershop.com/orders"
		}
	}
```
In the response, each order will have an ID specified in the **id** attribute that can be used to retrieve detailed information on the order. Also, **self** links will be provided to access each order individually.

## Paging Through Orders
By default, the above request will return all orders placed by a customer. However, you can also enable paging and receive results in pages of a limited size. For this purpose, use the **limit** and **offset** parameters in your request:
| URL | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /orders | Returns all orders made by a customer. |
| /orders?limit=10 | Returns maximum 10 orders. |
| /orders?offset=10&limit=10 | Returns orders 11 through 20. |
| /orders?offset=20 | Returns all orders starting from the 21st to the end. |

When paging is enabled, the **links** section of the JSON response will contain links for the first, previous, next and last pages.

**Sample response**
```js
{
		"data": [
			{
				"type": "orders",
				"id": "DE--1",
				"attributes": {
					"createdAt": "2018-11-01 17:57:14.354849",
					"totals": {
						"expenseTotal": 490,
						"discountTotal": 30237,
						"taxTotal": 42746,
						"subtotal": 297470,
						"grandTotal": 267723,
						"canceledTotal": 0
					},
					"currencyIsoCode": "EUR",
					"priceMode": "GROSS_MODE"
				},
				"links": {
					"self": "http://mysprykershop.com/orders/DE--1"
				}
			}
		],
		"links": {
			"self": "http://mysprykershop.com/orders?page[offset]=2&page[limit]=2",
			"last": "http://mysprykershop.com/orders?page[offset]=2&page[limit]=2",
			"first": "http://mysprykershop.com/orders?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=2",
			"prev": "http://mysprykershop.com/orders?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=2"
		}
	}
```

## Retrieving Specific Order
To retrieve detailed information on a specific order, including the items that the customer ordered, use the following endpoint:
`/orders/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}order_id{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}`
Sample request: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/orders/DE--1`
where `DE--1` is the Refernece Number of the order you want to retrieve.
