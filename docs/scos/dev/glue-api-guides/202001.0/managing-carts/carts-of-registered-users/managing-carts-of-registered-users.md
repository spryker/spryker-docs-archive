The **Carts API** provides access to management of customers' shopping carts. Carts come in two different forms: carts for registered customers and carts for guests. In your development, the resources provided by the API can support you in the development of shopping cart functionality.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
The following document covers the APIs for carts for **registered customers** only. If you want to know how to access carts of unregistered users, see [Managing Guest Carts](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/guest-carts/managing-guest-carts.html).
{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Carts API](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-cart-feature-integration.html).

## Guest Carts and Carts of Registered Users
Access to carts for registered users is provided by the **/carts** resource. Before accessing the resource, you need to authenticate a user first. 

Unlike guest carts, carts of registered users have an unlimited lifetime. Also, if the multiple carts feature is [integrated into your project](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/multiple-carts-feature-integration.html) and Glue is [enabled for multi-cart operations](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/multiple-carts-feature-integration.html), registered users can have as many carts as they want. In the B2B scenario, this allows for creating different carts for different purposes. For instance, registered users can have a cart for daily purchases and one more for purchases made once a month.

## Owned and Shared Carts
Registered users can [share carts](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/shared-carts-feature-overview.html) they own. Thus, a registered user can access both their personal carts and carts shared with them by other users. This feature allows company users to collaborate on company purchases as a team.
To be able to share carts, as well as access carts shared with them, customers need to authenticate as **Company User Accounts**. Each such account is a member of a certain Business Unit, and carts can be shared only among members of the same Unit. On the other hand, customers have the ability to impersonate as different Company Accounts depending on the job tasks they want to perform. Such accounts can belong to different Business Units, which means that any specific customer can have access to a different set of shared carts depending on the Company Account they impersonate as.

To use a Company Account, a customer needs to retrieve a bearer token for the account. The token is valid for a specific combination of an authenticated user and Company Account. It provides access to:
* the carts owned by the user;
* the carts shared with the Company Account.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
For details on how to receive the token, see [Logging In as Company User](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-b2b-account/authenticating-as-a-company-user.html).
{% endinfo_block %}

To be able to access shared carts, the API client needs to access the endpoints provided by the Carts API using the token received when impersonating as the Company Account. Doing so provides access to management of both the user's own carts and the carts shared with the current Company Account based on the bearer token presented.

Shared carts can be accessed and manipulated the same as regular carts. The only difference is that the list of actions that a user can perform on a shared cart depends on the permissions granted to them.

By default, there are 2 levels of permissions for shared carts: **read-only** and **full access**. If a user attempts to perform an unauthorized action on a shared cart, the API will respond with the **403 Forbidden** status code.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
For more details, see section *Retrieving Cart Permission Groups* in [Sharing Company User Carts](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/sharing-company-user-carts/retrieving-cart-permission-groups.html).
{% endinfo_block %}

To distinguish whether a specific cart is owned by a user directly or shared with them, you need to extend the responses of the endpoints with the **cart-permission-groups** resource relationship. For example, if you want to get all carts available to a company user and distinguish which of them are shared, send the following request: *GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts?**include=cart-permission-groups***. If a cart is shared with the user, it will contain the relationship, while if a cart is owned by the user directly, the relationship will not be present.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
For details on using the endpoint, see section *Retrieving Carts*.
{% endinfo_block %}

The following example represents **2** carts available to a user, where:
* **My Cart** is owned by the user;
* **Shared Cart** is shared.

**Code sample:**

## Creating Carts
To create a cart for a registered user, send a *POST* request to the following endpoint:

/carts

### Request
Request sample: *POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts*

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}
Carts created via Glue API are always set as the default carts for the user.
{% endinfo_block %}

**Attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | v | Sets the cart name.<br>This field can be set only if you are using the multiple carts feature. If you are operating in a single-cart environment, an attempt to set the value will result in an error with the **422 Unprocessable Entry** status code. |
| priceMode | Enum | v | Sets the price mode to be used for the cart. Possible values:<ul><li>GROSS_MODE - prices after tax;</li><li>NET_MODE - prices before tax.</li></ul>For details, see [Net &amp; Gross Prices](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/prices-feature-overview/prices-feature-overview.html). |

**Sample Response - 1 Cart**
    
```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "type": "carts",
            "id": "f8cfd611-4611-57d7-bc70-f81cee96a6af",
            "attributes": {
                "priceMode": "GROSS_MODE",
                "currency": "EUR",
                "store": "DE",
                "discounts": {},
                "totals": {
                    "expenseTotal": null,
                    "discountTotal": null,
                    "taxTotal": null,
                    "subtotal": null,
                    "grandTotal": null
                }
            },
            "links": {
                "self": "http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts/f8cfd611-4611-57d7-bc70-f81cee96a6af"
            }
        }
    ],
    "links": {
        "self": "http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts"
    }
}
```

**Sample Response - No Carts**
    
```json
{
    "data": [],
    "links": {
        "self": "http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts"
    }
}
```

To find out which products are placed in the cart, you can extend the response of the endpoint with the items and concrete-products resource relationships. The first relationship provides information on the items placed in the cart and their quantity, and the second one provides detailed information on the products.

Apart from that, you can identify permissions granted to users for each cart shared with them. To do so, extend the response with the cart-permission-groups resource relationship. 

Request sample: *GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/carts?include=items,concrete-products,cart-permission-groups*
