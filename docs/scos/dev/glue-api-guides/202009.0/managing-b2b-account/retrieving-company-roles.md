In corporate environments, where users act as company representatives rather than private buyers, companies can leverage [Company Roles](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/company-account-feature-overview/company-user-roles-and-permissions-overview.html) to distribute scopes and permissions among [Company Users](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/company-account-feature-overview/company-user-roles-and-permissions-overview.html). This endpoint allows retrieving information about the company roles.



## Installation
