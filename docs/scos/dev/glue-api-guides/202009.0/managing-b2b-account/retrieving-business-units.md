In the B2B world, users represent their companies rather than act on their own behalf. Such users, called [Company Accounts](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/company-account-feature-overview/company-accounts-overview.html), are organized in business units depending on their job role and the scope of their activity. The endpoints allows retrieving business unit information.

## Installation
