The Customer API allows creating customers and managing their account data. This includes the possibility to maintain a set of customer addresses as separate resources. In the checkout process, you can retrieve and use these address resources to speed up the buying process. The API supports authentication via OAuth 2.0 and password restoration.

In your development, these resources can help you to:

* Retrieve relevant customer information for any page where it is needed
* Enable customer registration
* Allow customer login and authentication
* Enrich customer profiles with additional data such as addresses

## Installation
For details on the modules that provide the API functionality and how to install them, see [Glue API: Customer Access Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-customer-account-management-feature-integration.html).
