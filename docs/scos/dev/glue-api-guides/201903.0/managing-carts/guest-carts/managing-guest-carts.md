The Carts API provides access to management of customers' shopping carts. The following document covers working with guest carts.

Guest carts come with an expiration date, which means that unregistered users can use their carts only for a limited time frame. After the lifetime of a guest cart expires, it is deleted by the system automatically.It is up to you to decide, how long you want them to be saved. Also, with the introduction of the Carts API, comes the possibility to persist guest carts. While carts for registered customers have always been persisted, the introduction of the API brings possibility to persist carts of guest customers.

Only one cart can be created for each guest customer.

{% info_block infoBox %}

If you want to know how to process carts of registered users, see [Managing Carts of Registered Users](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/carts-of-registered-users/managing-carts-of-registered-users.html).

{% endinfo_block %}


## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Carts API](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-cart-feature-integration.html).

## Resources for Accessing Guest Carts
The `/guest-carts` and `/guest-cart-items` resources provide endpoints to manage carts of users who haven't yet registered in the system or authenticated with the Glue REST API. Such carts provide the possibility for users to place items on a cart without the necessity to provide any registration information.

Each guest customer is identified by the value of the **X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** header. The header needs to be passed with each request related to a guest user. Glue REST API does not assign unique IDs to guest customer users. It is the responsibility of the API client to generate and manage unique IDs for all guest user sessions.

## Creating a Guest Cart
To create a guest cart for an unauthenticated user, you simply need to place an item or several items on a new guest card. To do this, send a POST request to the following endpoint:

`/guest-cart-items`

Request sample: `POST http://mysprykershop.com/guest-cart-items`

### Request
#### Headers:

`X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id` - specifies a unique guest user ID for the new cart. If the specified user already has a cart, the item or items will be added on their existing cart instead of creating a new one.

#### Attributes:

|  Attribute| Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sku | String | ✓ | Specifies the SKU part number of the item to place on the new guest cart. |
| quantity | String | ✓ | Specifies the number of items to place on the guest cart. |

**Sample Request Body**
```js
{
	"data": {
		"type": "guest-cart-items",
		"attributes": {
			"sku": "022_21994751",
			"quantity": 1
		}
	}
}
```

### Response
If a request was successful and a cart was created, the endpoint responds with a RestCartsResponse containing information about the new cart.

## Retrieving Carts of Guest Users
There are 2 possible ways how you can access a cart of a guest user

* By the unique identifier of the guest user
{% info_block infoBox %}
The user's unique identifier is passed in the **X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** header when creating a cart. It is managed by the API client.
{% endinfo_block %}
`/guest-carts`
Request sample: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/guest-carts`
**Headers:**
**X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** - specifies the unique guest user ID.

* By the unique identifier of the cart
{% info_block infoBox %}
The unique identifier of the cart is passed by the Glue API in the id attribute of a **RestCartsResponse** when a new guest cart is created.
{% endinfo_block %}
`/guest-carts/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}guestCartId{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}`
Request sample: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/guest-carts/2506b65c-164b-5708-8530-94ed7082e802`
where `2506b65c-164b-5708-8530-94ed7082e802` is the ID of the cart you need.

### Response
No matter which of the 2 endpoints you use, it will respond with a **RestCartsResponse**.

## Assigning Guest Cart to a Registered Customer
Initially, guest carts are anonymous. In other words, they are not related to any particular user. However, if an anonymous customer authenticates or registers in the system, you can link their guest cart with their user account, so that they don't lose the list of products they want to purchase. For this purpose, you need to transform a guest cart into a registered user cart.

To assign a guest cart to a new customer, send a request to create a customer and pass the **X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** header as a part of your request. To assign a cart to an already registered customer who wants to log in, include the **X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** header in the authentication request.

{% info_block infoBox %}
The user's unique identifier is passed in the **X-Anonymous-Customer-Unique-Id** header when creating a cart. It is managed by the API client.
