---

The **Checkout API** allows you to place orders and retrieve checkout information.

In order to create a checkout experience, we offer an endpoint that provides you with all checkout data. The data is based on customers themselves and their shopping carts. For registered customers, the endpoint also provides their registered addresses as well as the applicable payment and shipment methods. If necessary, the endpoint may be called each time additional customer data is provided. For example, for the purposes of fraud protection, specific payment methods can be disallowed for certain delivery addresses. In this case, a second call may be needed for verification of payment method restrictions.

Apart from that, the API also provides an endpoint that allows placing an order.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Checkout API](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/201907.0/glue-api/glue-api-checkout-feature-integration.html).

## Place Order
To place an order, send a POST request to the following endpoint:
`/checkout`
Request sample: `POST http://mysprykershop.com/checkout`

### Request
A request should contain:

* Valid customer information (e.g. first name, last name, salutation etc).
* Payment and shipment methods. They should exist in the system.
* Valid shipping and billing addresses.
* Also, the customer's cart should not be empty.
