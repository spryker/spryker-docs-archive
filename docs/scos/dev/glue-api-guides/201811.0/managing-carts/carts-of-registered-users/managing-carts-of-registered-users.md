The **Carts API** provides access to management of customers' shopping carts. The following document covers working with **carts of registered users**.

{% info_block infoBox %}

If you want to know how to process carts of registered users, see [Managing Guest Carts](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/managing-carts/guest-carts/managing-guest-carts.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

## Guest Carts and Carts of Registered Users
Access to carts of registered users is provided by the /carts resource. Before accessing the resource, you need to authenticate a user first. For more details, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).

Unlike guest carts, carts of registered users have unlimited lifetime. Registered users can have as many carts as they want.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see Carts API.

## Creating Registered User Cart
To create a guest cart for a registered user, send a POST request to the following endpoint:
`/carts`
Request sample: `POST http://mysprykershop.com/carts`

{% info_block infoBox %}

Apart from creating a new cart, you can also convert a cart of a guest customer to a cart of a registered user when a guest user registers or authenticates. For details, see section **Assigning Guest Cart to Registered Customer** in Managing Guest Carts.

{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block errorBox %}

To use this endpoint, you need to authenticate first. For details, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).

{% endinfo_block %}
