The Customer API provides functionality for the creation of customers and administration of their account data. This administration includes the possibility to maintain a set of customer addresses as separate resources. In checkout process, these address resources can be retrieved and used to speed up the buying process. On the authentication side, the API supports authentication via OAuth 2.0 protocol and password restoring functionality.

In your development, these resources can help you to:

* Retrieve relevant customer information for any page where customer information is needed
* Enable customer registration
* Allow customer login/authentication
* Enrich customer profiles with additional data such as addresses

## Installation
For details on the modules that provide the API functionality and how to install them, see [Customer API Feature Integration](/docs/scos/dev/feature-integration-guides/{{page.version}}/glue-api/glue-api-customer-account-management-feature-integration.html).

## Creating a Customer
To create a new customer user, send a POST request to the following endpoint:
`/customers`
Request sample: `POST http://mysprykershop.com/customers`
Attributes:
| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| acceptedTerms | Boolean | ✓ | Specifies whether the customer has accepted the terms of service. For a new customer to be created, this parameter needs to be set to true. |
| confirmPassword | String | ✓ | Specifies a password confirmation for the account of the new customer. |
| email | String | ✓ | Specifies customer's last email address. The address must be unique in the system. |
| firstName | String | ✓ | Specifies customer's first name. |
| lastName | String | ✓ | Specifies customer's last name. |
| password | String | ✓ | Specifies a password (7 characters or more) for the account of the new customer. This password will be used by the customer to access their account. |
| salutation | String | ✓ | Specifies a salutation for a new customer. |

**Request sample body**
```js
{
  "data": {
    "type": "customers",
    "attributes": {
        "salutation": "Mr",
        "firstName":"John",
        "lastName":"Doe",
        "email":"jdoe@example.com",
        "password":"change123",
        "confirmPassword":"change123",
        "acceptedTerms":true
    }
  }
}
```

If a customer was created successfully, the endpoint will respond with a **RestCustomersResponse**.

**Sample response**
```js
{
	"data": {
		"type": "customers",
		"id": "DE--25",
		"attributes": {
			"firstName": "John",
			"lastName": "Doe",
			"gender": null,
			"dateOfBirth": null,
			"salutation": "Mr",
			"createdAt": "2018-11-06 08:15:02.694668",
			"updatedAt": "2018-11-06 08:15:02.694668"
		},
		"links": {
			"self": "http://mysprykershop.com/customers/DE--25"
		}
	}
}
```

After a customer has been created, you can authenticate them in the REST API and perform actions on their behalf. For details, see Authentication and Authorization. The **id** attribute of the **RestCustomersResponse** specifies a unique customer identifier that can later be used to access the new customer via REST API requests.

| Field* | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| firstName | String | Customer's first name |
| lastName | String | Customer's last name |
| gender | String | Gender of the customer |
| dateOfBirth | String | Customer's date of birth |
| salutation | String | Salutation to use when addressing the customer |

| Code | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| 422 | Terms of service were not accepted |

| 414 | The provided gender is invalid |

## Retrieving Customer Information
To retrieve information about a customer, use the following endpoint:
`/customers/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}customerReference{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}`
Request sample: `GET http://mysprykershop.com/customers/DE-25`
where `DE-25` is the unique identifier of the customer you want to retrieve.

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication" %}

To use this endpoint, customers need to authenticate first. For details, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

If a customer with the specified ID was found, the endpoint will respond with a **RestCustomersRequest**.

## Editing a Customer
To modify an existing customer account, send a _PATCH_ request to the following endpoint:
`/customers/{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}customerReference{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}`

{% info_block infoBox "Modifying Customer Addresses " %}

You need to use specialized endpoints to retrieve and manage addresses registered for a customer. For details, see [Managing the List of Customer Addresses](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/manging-customers/managing-customers.html#managing-the-list-of-customer-addresses).

{% endinfo_block %}

Request sample: `PATCH http://mysprykershop.com/customers/DE-25`
where `DE-25` is the unique identifier of the customer you want to modify.

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication " %}

To use this endpoint, customers need to authenticate first. For details, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

To modify a customer, the client must send a **RestCustomersRequest**.

**Request sample**
```js
{
		"data" : {
			"type": "customers"
			"attributes": {
					"lastName": "Johnson",
					"email": "example@mail.com",
				}
		}
	}

```

If a customer is modified successfully, the endpoint will respond with a **RestCustomersResponse**.

**Sample response**
```js
{

			"type": "customers",
			"id": "DE--25",
			"attributes": {
				"firstName": null,
				"lastName": "Johnson",

## Managing the List of Customer Addresses

{% info_block warningBox "Authentication " %}

Only authenticated users can manage customer addresses. For details on how to authenticate a customer, see [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/scos/dev/glue-api-guides/{{page.version}}/authentication-and-authorization.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

## Adding an Address
