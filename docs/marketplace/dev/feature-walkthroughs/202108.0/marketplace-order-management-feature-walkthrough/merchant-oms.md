Merchant Oms provides a dedicated Oms flow for Merchant Orders and their Merchants.

Merchant Oms has no direct communication channel with the plain Oms.
The synchronization of state between an Order and a Merchant Order usually takes place by listening to events and running commands on them.

The following diagram illustrates how Oms and Merchant Oms can interact.

Additionally, the feature allows different Oms flows to be assigned to different merchants.
If you have some enterprise Merchants on your Marketplace and you want to enable different business models on your marketplace, this might be helpful.
