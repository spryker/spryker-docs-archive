The *Marketplace Product Offer* entity is created when multiple merchants sell the same product on the Marketplace. The product offer is a variation of a concrete product with its own specific price (and volume price) and stock. It can be “owned” by any entity, however, in a B2C or B2B Marketplace, it is owned by a [merchant](/docs/marketplace/dev/feature-walkthroughs/{{page.version}}/marketplace-merchant-feature-walkthrough.html).

The Marketplace product offer has its own validity dates and its own availability calculation based on its reservations.

The product offer re-uses and extends concrete product features. All product-related data is stored and processed as concrete products.
All offer-related data is stored in a separate entity and linked to a concrete product.

The Marketplace Product Offer feature contains both merchant product offer and product offer concepts. Merchant product offer extends product offer by adding a pointer to a merchant.
