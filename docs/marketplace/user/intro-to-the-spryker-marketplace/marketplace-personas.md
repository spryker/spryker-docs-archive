A marketplace extension provided by Spryker Cloud Commerce OS covers a wide range of needs for sellers and buyers and presupposes the fulfillment of multiple actions by various types of users in different areas of the Marketplace. This document describes the different types of users - personas, that function within the Marketplace.

A *Marketplace* is a type of e-commerce website where products or services are delivered and fulfilled by multiple sellers or *merchants* to the buyers, whereas transactions are processed by the Marketplace operator.

*Marketplace operator* is the company that owns the Marketplace. It can also sell on the marketplace as the [main merchant](/docs/marketplace/user/features/{{site.version}}/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/main-merchant-concept.html).

## Marketplace administrator

A *Marketplace administrator* works for a Marketplace operator in the Spryker Back Office. A Marketplace administrator is also known as an admin user for the whole Marketplace and is responsible for the following actions:
- Managing merchants.
- Managing offers of all products from all merchants.
- Managing all products from all merchants.
- Controlling all orders from merchants.

## Merchant user

A *merchant user* is the employee of the merchant and their company who uses the Merchant Portal to sell in the Marketplace. Merchant user is able to perform the following actions:
- Creating and edit merchant's product offers on products.
- Managing merchant products.
- Managing promotions.
- Managing stock and product availability of the merchant's products and offers.
- Updating, approving/denying merchant orders.
