### Reference information: Price pane

|ATTRIBUTE  | DESCRIPTION   |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Store          | [Store](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/dev/tutorials-and-howtos/howtos/howto-set-up-multiple-stores.html) in which the price will be displayed. |
| Currency       | Currency in which the concrete product price is defined.           |
| Net default    | Default item price before tax. |
| Gross default  | Item price after tax.   |
| Net original   | Item price before tax displayed as a strikethrough beside the default price on the Storefront. It is usually used to indicate a price change. |
| Gross original |Item price after tax displayed as a strikethrough beside the default price on the Storefront. It is usually used to indicate a price change. |
| Quantity       | Number of items for which the price is defined. This field ID used to define the volume prices for the concrete product.  |

### Adding volume prices

Let's say you have a product that you want to sell with a special price if a user wants to buy a specific number of the same product. For example, a laptop costs €354.35, but you have defined that if a user buys three items, the cost will be €340 instead of €354.35. In this case, you can define a product quantity starting from which a special [volume price](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/prices-feature-overview/volume-prices-overview.html) applies.
