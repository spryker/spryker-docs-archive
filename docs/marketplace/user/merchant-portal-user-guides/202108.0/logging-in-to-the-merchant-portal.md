To use the Merchant Portal, you have to log in. This document describes how you can do that.


## Prerequisites

To log in to the Merchant Portal, a [merchant user](/docs/marketplace/user/features/{{page.version}}/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/merchant-users-overview.html) needs to be [created](/docs/marketplace/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/marketplace/merchants/managing-merchant-users.html#creating-a-merchant-user) and [activated in the Back Office](/docs/marketplace/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/marketplace/merchants/managing-merchant-users.html#activating-and-deactivating-the-merchant-users) by the Marketplace administrator.

Each section in this article contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating a password

Once the merchant user is [activated](/docs/marketplace/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/marketplace/merchants/managing-merchant-users.html#activating-and-deactivating-the-merchant-users), an email with the password reset link is sent. To reset the password:

1. Click the link provided in the email. The **Reset Password** page opens.

   ![Reset password page](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Marketplace/user+guides/Merchant+Portal+user+guides/Login+and+logout/set-password-for-merchant-portal.png)

2. In the **Password** field, enter the new password.

3. In **Repeat Password**, enter the new password again to confirm it.

4. Click **Reset** to update the password.

The password is reset and you can use it for login.
