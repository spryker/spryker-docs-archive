This document describes the attributes that you see and enter on different product pages.

---

## Products page

On the **Products** page, you see the following:

* Product ID (autogenerated), name, and SKU.
* The tax set applied to this product.
* The number of variants this product has.
* The status of the product (active/inactive).
* Product type (product, gift card, product bundle).
* Stores where the product is available (in case you have multiple stores in your project).

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

For the [Marketplace](/docs/marketplace/user/intro-to-the-spryker-marketplace/marketplace-concept.html) project, you can also filter the products belonging to a certain Merchant:

{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

Upon entering the page, all merchants are enabled by default.

{% endinfo_block %}

A set of the following examples will help you understand what your online store customers will see once you set up volume prices, product alternatives, original and default prices, and discontinue a product. You will also find an example of a product bundle.

## Volume prices

Let's say you have a product that you want to sell at a special price if a user wants to buy a specific number of the same product. For example, a Smartphone with a flash memory equals 16GB costs 25 Euros per item, but you have defined that if a user buys three items, the cost will be 23 Euros instead of 25.

## Discontinued products and their alternatives

Let's say the Smartphone with a flash memory equals 16GB is no longer popular, and it is more efficient for you to discontinue it. But you need to propose some replacements for it to make sure that the user journey is successful. You discontinue this product variant and set up other products to be displayed as alternatives.

## Product bundles

Let's say you want to simplify the user journey and allow buying a bundle of products that are commonly used together (for example, pens, notebooks, copy paper, and other stationery). You create a bundle for that purpose.

![bundle](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Back+Office+User+Guides/Products/Products/Managing+products/Products:+Reference+Information/Bundle.gif)

## Default and original prices

If you want to display the price difference to show what the price was before and how it changed, you add both, Default and Original prices. The default prices are displayed in the online store as a current price, while the original one is displayed strikethrough.
