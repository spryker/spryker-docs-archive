This document describes how to manage abstract and concrete products.

To start managing products, go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> **Products**.

## Activating a product

The abstract product is inactive until at least one product variant is activated. You should understand that there is no option to activate

To activate a product:
1. Navigate to the product variant of the product that you want to activate: **Edit abstract product** > **Variant** > **Edit product variant**.
2.  Click **Activate** on the top of the **Edit Concrete Product** page.
Starting now, the product is visible to the customers of your online store.

{% info_block infoBox "Note" %}

Each variant needs to be activated to be visible to your customers.

{% endinfo_block %}

**Tips and tricks**
<br>If you want to hide the product variant from your customers at some point of time, you just deactivate it using the same procedure described above. This deactivates only the product variant. The abstract product is active until at least one its variant is active.

## Viewing a product

To review the product details without actually editing them, do the following:
1. In the **Actions** column of the abstract product you want to view, click **View**.
2. On the **View Product** page, you can navigate to the view product variant, initiate the editing flow for it, or manage its attributes.

**Tips and tricks**
<br>If you notice something you would like to change for your product, in the top right corner of the page, click **Edit**.

### Filtering product options by merchants

You can view product options of all merchants or individual ones.
To filter the product options by merchants, in the **Merchants** dropdown, select a merchant. The **Product options list** table will display only the product options of the selected merchant.

## Managing product attributes

When you see the **Manage Attributes** option, keep in mind that you manage the attributes like brand but not the super attributes. Such attributes like brand do not define the product variants differentiation, meaning they are not used while defining the concrete products of an abstract product. They rather go to the details section on the product details page in your online store. You can manage attributes for both abstract and concrete products.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

The attributes that you add are taken from the **Products** > **Attributes** section of the Back Office. So the attribute you want to define should exist in that section.

{% endinfo_block %}

To manage the product attributes:
1. Select the **Manage Attributes** option for the concrete or abstract product in the **Actions** column or from the top right corner of the **Edit** page.
2. On the **Manage Attributes for Product** page, start typing the first three letters of the attribute key.
3. Select the suggested value and click **Add**.
4. In the **Attributes** section, define the **Default** value for your attributes and specify the value for the **locales**.
Repeat the procedure if needed.
5. Once done, click **Save**.
Check the **References** section to see the examples of how the attributes look like.
