The Spryker Marketplace platform offers sales opportunities to everyone. To help support the [Enterprise Marketplace](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/marketplace/user/intro-to-spryker-marketplace/marketplace-concept.html) model, not only the 3rd party merchants but also the company owner of the Marketplace store can sell their products and offers online. We call this company the *main merchant*.

Thus, the main merchant acts as a common [marketplace merchant](/docs/marketplace/user/features/{{page.version}}/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview.html) having all its characteristics.

## Main merchant orders and returns

Being both a [marketplace operator](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/marketplace/user/intro-to-spryker-marketplace/marketplace-personas.html) and a seller and already performing tasks in the Back Office, the main merchant manages their [merchant orders](/docs/marketplace/user/features/{{page.version}}/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/merchant-order-overview.html) also in the Back Office. For details, see [Managing main merchant orders](/docs/marketplace/user/merchant-portal-user-guides/{{page.version}}/orders/managing-merchant-orders.html).

## Main merchant state machine

To manage merchant orders of the main merchant, the *main merchant state machine* exists. Out of the box, the main merchant state machine provides the following states:
- Created
- New
- Canceled
- Left the merchant location
- Arrived at the distribution center
- Shipped
- Delivered
- Closed

The workflow of the main merchant state machine is schematically displayed in the following diagram:

## Main merchant returns

If the [Marketplace Return Management](/docs/marketplace/user/features/{{page.version}}/marketplace-return-management-feature-overview.html) feature is integrated into the project, the main merchant state machine obtains an additional return subprocess, and the flow looks like this:
