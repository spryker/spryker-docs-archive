The *Marketplace Cart Notes* feature lets you include a "Notes" field on the cart page. Buyers can add notes to a particular item or the whole cart, for example, some special instructions about how to prepare and deliver an order.

Cart and item notes on the Storefront:

## Current constraints
In a situation, when the same product variants are added to the cart with different notes, the variants get merged with the same note.
