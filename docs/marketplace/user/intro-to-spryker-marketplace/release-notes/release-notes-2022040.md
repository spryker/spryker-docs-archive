## Marketplace Product Approval Process

The Operator's main challenge is to ensure the quality of the data in the marketplace.  The Merchant Product Approval Process feature provides the marketplace operator with more control of 3rd-party merchants’ products.
The status can be either of the following: draft, waiting for approval, approved, and denied, with the option to set a default status per merchant.
